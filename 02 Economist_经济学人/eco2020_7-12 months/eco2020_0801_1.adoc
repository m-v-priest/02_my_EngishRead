- *LAY, PUT, ROLL, ETC. OUT THE WELCOME MAT (FOR SB)* : ( especially NAmE ) to make sb feel welcome; to try to attract visitors, etc. 使感到受欢迎；设法吸引（客人等）

- 撕掉欢迎地毯
当covid-19消退时，全球移徙是否会再次开始?
许多对移民的约束限制, 可能会比疫情更持久

EVERY WEEKEND `the removal 搬迁；迁移 vans`  搬家卡车 *come to* a leafy suburb of Dubai. Expatriates 居住在国外的人；侨民 *are packing up* 打点（行装）. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), of which Dubai *is* part, *will lose* 10% of its population this year, *reckons* Nasser al-Shaikh, an `ex-finance minister` 前财政部长. Covid-19 *has devastated* 彻底破坏；摧毁；毁灭 the Gulf’s trade-and-transport hub. Emirates, Dubai’s airline, *says* it *may cut* 30% of its roughly 100,000 staff.

- 每个周末，搬家车都会来到绿树成荫的迪拜郊区。外籍人士正在收拾行装。据前财政部长Nasser al-Shaikh估计，包括迪拜在内的阿拉伯联合酋长国(UAE), 今年的人口将减少10%。Covid-19摧毁了海湾地区的贸易和运输枢纽。迪拜的阿联酋航空公司(Emirates)表示，它可能会在大约10万名员工中裁员30%。

Nearly all of those (*losing their jobs* in the UAE) *are* migrants, who are almost 90% of the population. Without a job, they *have to leave the country*. *This is irksome(a.)  使人烦恼的；令人生气的 enough* if they *are* bankers 银行老板（或要员）；银行家 or architects 建筑师. For those who *used to wash(v.) dishes* in hotels /or *lay(v.)（尤指轻轻地或小心地）放置，安放，搁; （在某物上）摊开，涂，敷；用一层…覆盖 bricks* on building sites that *are now shuttered*(v.)以百叶窗遮闭, it *can be a nightmare*. Some 500,000 Indians in the UAE *have registered to be evacuated* （把人从危险的地方）疏散，转移，撤离; less than half *have been*.

- irksome : irk·some  adj.   /ˈɜːksəm/
( formal ) annoying or irritating 使人烦恼的；令人生气的
SYN tiresome +
=> irk,愤怒，-some,形容词后缀。来自中古英语irken,厌倦的，厌恶的，可能来自PIE*werg,工作，词源同work,organ.词义激怒可能是受ire的影响。 +
.. I found the restrictions *irksome*. 我对那些限制感到很烦。

- 在阿联酋，几乎所有失去工作的人, 都是移民，他们几乎占人口的90%。没有工作，他们不得不离开这个国家。如果他们是银行家或建筑师，这就够烦人的了。对于那些曾经在酒店洗盘子, 或在现在已经关闭的建筑工地砌砖的人来说，这简直是一场噩梦。大约50万在阿联酋的印度人, 已经登记准备撤离; 其中有不到一半的人已经离开了。


Many blue-collar 从事体力劳动的；蓝领的 migrants *have waited so long for flights*(n.) (that they *have blown 炸开;吹 their savings* 储蓄；存款). Asad (*not* his real name) *got a $1,100 pay-off*  辞退金；遣散费;回报；报偿 when he *lost his construction job* in April, but *has had to spend nearly all of it on food and other necessities*, which *are far costlier* 昂贵的；代价高的 in Dubai *than* back home in Pakistan. This week *he was huddling* （通常因寒冷或害怕）挤在一起 outside the airport *for a cigarette* before a flight to Lahore 巴基斯坦一城市名. “Two years [and] *I go home with almost nothing*,” he says. Some of his friends *are even worse off* 恶化，情况更坏；愈加贫穷的；每况愈下的: they *still owe(v.)欠（债）；欠（账） money to* the labour brokers 经纪人；掮客 who *brought them to the Gulf* in the first place.

- 许多蓝领移民等待航班的时间太长，以至于他们花光了自己的积蓄。今年4月，阿萨德(化名)失去了建筑工作，得到了1100美元的补偿，但他不得不将这笔钱几乎全部花在食品和其他必需品上，这些东西在迪拜比在巴基斯坦要贵得多。本周，在飞往拉合尔(Lahore)的航班前，他挤在机场外, 吸了支烟。“两年了，我回家时几乎一无所有，”他说。他的一些朋友的情况甚至更糟:他们仍然欠劳工经纪人的钱，是他们当初把他们带到海湾地区的。


Covid-19 *has immobilised 使不动；使不能正常运作 the world*. Planes *are grounded*  使停飞；阻止…起飞, borders *are closed*, people *are hunkered 蹲；蹲坐；蹲下 down at home*. Every country *has restricted travel* because of the coronavirus -- *issuing more than 65,000 rules* in total. Some countries *are starting to open up* but *it will be a long time* before people *can globetrot(v.)环球旅行 as freely as before*.

- Covid-19使世界停滞不前。飞机停飞，边境关闭，人们被迫呆在家里。每个国家都因为冠状病毒而限制旅行——总共颁布了超过65,000条规则。一些国家已经开始重新开放，但人们还需要很长时间, 才能像以前那样自由地环球旅行。

Travel curbs have made cross-border investment harder. Before committing money to a venture, you need to be “able to walk the factory floor” and “physically validate what you read in the PowerPoint presentation,” says Stephen Forshaw of Temasek, Singapore’s sovereign-wealth fund. Now, if you are not already there, you can’t.

Even if tourism and business travel return to something resembling normal as the pandemic fades, some restrictions on migration may remain. Where people had a settled right to move which was temporarily suspended for health reasons, within the European Union for example, that right will surely be restored. But where permission to move is granted by the host government, it may become permanently harder.

Much will depend on how covid-19 affects people’s view of immigrants. Fear could make them more hostile. Many will conclude that letting in foreigners is a health risk (though the vast majority of travellers are not migrants). Because the virus originated in China, bigots in many countries have mistreated people who look Chinese. Bigots in China, meanwhile, have evicted black immigrants from their homes and barred them from hotels, after hearing a rumour that Africans were likely to be infected. Future migrants will not quickly forget footage of a no-blacks sign on a McDonald’s in Guangzhou.

With economies reeling, many will also conclude that it is time to stop immigrants from competing with natives for scarce jobs. In countries where lots of migrants have been laid off and are allowed to live on the dole, locals may resent the expense.

The pandemic might also hurt illicit migrants. Some of the snooping tools that governments have introduced to trace the spread of covid-19 could outlast it, making it harder to work in the shadows. In China, to take the most extreme example, malls and subways often deny entry to those who lack an app on their phone to show they are healthy, which no one can get without a formal address. “It may become virtually impossible to live without papers,” writes Roberto Castillo of AfricansInChina.net.



In other ways, however, the pandemic could make people friendlier towards immigrants, many of whom have risked their lives to do essential work during the crisis (see chart 1). Health services in rich countries could not function without them (see chart 2). Roughly half the doctors in Australia and Israel are foreign-born. In America migrants were 14% of the population in 2018 but 29% of doctors. Medical research, of the sort that will one day yield a vaccine, depends on teams of the most talented minds from around the world getting together and collaborating. Some 40% of medical and life scientists in America are foreign-born. The Oxford Vaccine Group, which unveiled promising vaccine trial results in July, includes scientists from practically everywhere.



Immigrants also do a big share of the jobs that “make it possible for the rest of us to work safely from home,” observes Doris Meissner of the Migration Policy Institute, a think-tank. They grow food (42% of farm workers in America are foreign-born), deliver things (18% of industrial truckers) and disinfect floors (47% of hotel maids and 25% of janitors). More than half of American tech giants were founded by immigrants or their children. That includes Zoom, Amazon and Google, without whose products remote working would be tricky.

With covid-19 rife, immigration policy is not at the top of the agenda anywhere. But it is bubbling up. Europe seems more hostile to migrants crossing the Mediterranean. In Australia the opposition Labor Party’s immigration spokeswoman said the country should move away from its “lazy” reliance on “cheap” foreign workers who take “jobs Australians could do”.

Among rich countries the debate is playing out most dramatically in America. Long before covid-19 was discovered, Mr Trump associated immigrants with germs. He spoke of “tremendous infectious disease…pouring across the border” with Mexico. Stephen Miller, a hardline adviser, had long argued that public health could provide a legal justification for shutting them out. After the coronavirus struck, Mr Trump enacted a wishlist of restrictions.

He banned foreign travellers from China. This did not protect America since Americans were free to return home from covid-19 hotspots. Nonetheless, Mr Trump praised his own decisiveness. “I banned China,” he repeated, often.

Immigration to the United States was falling even before the pandemic, thanks to aggressive enforcement, reduced quotas and the eloquence with which Mr Trump tells migrants they are not wanted. The net increase in the foreign-born population was a mere 200,000 in 2017-18, down from over 1m in 2013-14. Mr Trump seems eager to lower that number to zero.

In June he issued a “Proclamation Suspending Entry of Aliens Who Present a Risk to the US Labour Market Following the Coronavirus Outbreak”. It froze four types of visa for the rest of the year: H-1Bs (for highly skilled workers); H-2Bs (for less-skilled workers); J visas, for au pairs, temporary summer workers and some academics; and L visas, for professionals who are moved within the same company.

With every word, they drop knowledge

These new rules, combined with a neartotal shutdown of visa offices, will destroy American jobs, not create them. Holders of H-1B visas mostly work in information technology, where there is a skills shortage. Adam Ozimek of Upwork, a freelancing platform, estimates that the use of IT to enable remote working has reduced the risk of job losses by between a third and a half. And a new paper by Britta Glennon of the Wharton School finds that when America restricts H-1B visas, multinationals do not hire more Americans. They shift operations to Canada, India and China.

Curbing the flow of talent will constrict economic growth. Consider the baffling decision to stop intra-company transfers. Multinationals routinely bring in key managers or technicians from abroad to solve bottlenecks. If they cannot do this, their businesses are less likely to succeed—so they will be less likely to invest in America at all. “About 80% of my portfolio consists of at least one founder who has immigrant roots,” says Joydeep Bhattacharyya, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. “Many have started outside the United States, and then the entrepreneur has moved over, employing a lot of American workers. This year it’s completely stopped. No matter how well they’re doing, they can’t come.”

Banning au pairs won’t create jobs for Americans, either. On the contrary: by providing cheap child care, au pairs make it easier for American parents to go out to work. Families that couldn’t afford a nanny can often afford an au pair because part of the au pair’s compensation is a place to stay and a chance to learn English.

Jason Patwell, a defence contractor, is a single father of three boys, one of whom has special needs. He was aghast when he realised that an au pair would not be coming. “I would love to say I have a back-up plan, but I don’t. I can throw money at the problem, and go into debt. I’ll survive until the end of the summer,” he says.

In worse-off countries, where the state lacks the cash to cushion the economic shock of covid-19, the debate about migration is even more fraught. Consider South Africa, where xenophobia was common, sometimes lethally so, even before the pandemic. Like America, South Africa shares a long, porous land border with a large continent where wages are much lower. Workers and traders flock there from all over Africa. The World Bank estimates that each one creates on average two jobs for natives, because migrants import skills, start businesses and spend money. But most South Africans think otherwise. They are nearly twice as likely to say that immigrants are a burden than to say they make the country stronger, says a Pew poll. (In America, those figures are reversed.)

One of the first things South Africa’s government did to fight covid-19 was to build a 40km fence on the border with Zimbabwe. It has more holes than a bagel warehouse. A local farmer calls it “a complete farce”. It would not be much of a public-health measure in any case. Covid-19 has largely entered South Africa by air, from Europe, and is circulating widely.

In March a minister announced that foreign-owned shops, which are the only outlets in many areas and are disproportionally owned by Ethiopians and Somalis, would have to close. Locals were forced to travel miles to buy groceries, which helped spread the virus. Enforcement was relaxed in April, but the hassles did not end.

When the offices that issue permits were closed, the government promised that all expiring permits would automatically be extended, first until July 31st, then until October 31st. However, police and soldiers have allegedly detained and demanded bribes from foreigners with out-of-date papers. A few Zimbabweans got on privately organised repatriation buses. Upon leaving South Africa, some were banned from returning for five years, despite promises to the contrary. An overhaul of immigration laws is due later this year—to be drafted by securocrats, not economists.

Some countries may emerge from the pandemic more open to migration. In Japan covid-19 may have spurred the government to make its pro-immigration policies more explicit. The country is ageing and needs young foreigners to clean hotels and staff shops. The polite fiction was that many of these foreign workers were “trainees”, learning skills to bring back home.

Got a lot farther by working a lot harder

But from April the government ditched the requirement that these “trainees” stick with the firm that sponsored their visa. It did not want to deport migrants who had lost jobs in one sector (eg hotels) when others (eg hospitals) were crying out for them. So it announced that they could switch employers. By doing so, it has dropped the pretence that the trainee programme is about anything more than coping with Japan’s own labour shortage, argues Menju Toshihiro of the Japan Centre for International Exchange, a non-profit. Indeed, migrant workers are so valuable that calls to exclude them from the government’s covid-19 stimulus package fell on deaf ears.



Do they know what you overcame?

In Britain anti-immigration sentiment peaked around the time of the Brexit referendum of 2016, but has since subsided. Many who voted to leave the EU because they thought there was too much migration now feel Britain has taken back control of its borders. In the wake of covid-19, views of immigration will continue to mollify, predicts Jonathan Portes of King’s College London. A recent decision to extend residence rights to up to 3m Hong Kongers passed without fuss. Under a proposed points-based system, EU nationals will find it harder to work in the UK, and few workers from anywhere will be admitted if they make less than £25,600 ($33,231) a year. But the rules will be looser for health workers. And voters have noticed that many migrants who make less than £25,600 have been indispensable of late. “Care workers, bus drivers and supermarket staff all fulfil essential functions, and it is far from obvious that there will be public support for an immigration system that excludes them all in favour of relatively junior bankers,” writes Mr Portes.

In America, for all Mr Trump’s fist-waving, the share of people who think that illegal immigration is a “very big problem” has fallen markedly since the pandemic began, from 43% last year to 28% in June. This could be because the influx has dried up, or because, compared with covid-19 itself, nothing seems like a “very big problem”. The country is divided. A new Economist/YouGov poll finds Americans roughly evenly split between wanting immigration to resume after the pandemic at the same pace as before or faster (40%) versus slower or remaining frozen (42%).

Still, the inability of populist leaders such as Mr Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro to cope with covid-19 could cost them their jobs—and thereby usher in a less drawbridge-up type of government. The Economist’s prediction model gives Joe Biden about a nine-in-ten chance of winning the American presidency in November. He would clearly be different. He says “Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants.” He could immediately revoke Mr Trump’s executive orders and stop separating migrant children from their parents. He vows to promote laws to increase the number of skilled migrants, create an easier path to citizenship and let cities with labour shortages petition for more migrants.

Covid-19 has shown that the freedom to migrate, which was always constrained, can be cancelled at will when people are scared. Consider Subha Nawer Pushpita’s experiences. She is a Bangladeshi studying computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. America was built by people like her: immigrants at MIT have won more Nobel prizes than China. So she was gobsmacked to learn, on July 6th, that she might be deported. The government said that foreigners at American universities who take only remote classes would have to leave the country.

Eighteen states sued to have the rule scrapped. The week after, it was. “I felt incredibly relieved and excited. I called my mom and I was shouting,” recalls Ms Pushpita. She will be able to study. But many others won’t. On July 24th the Trump administration said that new foreign students who have not yet reached America will be barred if their classes are taught remotely. “As long as he’s in office, something else will pop up,” sighs Ms Pushpita.

== Tearing up the welcome mat

When covid-19 recedes, will global migration start again?

Many curbs on immigrants could outlast the pandemic

Aug 1st 2020 | DUBAI, JOHANNESBURG, SINGAPORE, SYDNEY, TOKYO AND WASHINGTON, DC


EVERY WEEKEND the removal vans come to a leafy suburb of Dubai. Expatriates are packing up. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), of which Dubai is part, will lose 10% of its population this year, reckons Nasser al-Shaikh, an ex-finance minister. Covid-19 has devastated the Gulf’s trade-and-transport hub. Emirates, Dubai’s airline, says it may cut 30% of its roughly 100,000 staff.

Nearly all of those losing their jobs in the UAE are migrants, who are almost 90% of the population. Without a job, they have to leave the country. This is irksome enough if they are bankers or architects. For those who used to wash dishes in hotels or lay bricks on building sites that are now shuttered, it can be a nightmare. Some 500,000 Indians in the UAE have registered to be evacuated; less than half have been.

Many blue-collar migrants have waited so long for flights that they have blown their savings. Asad (not his real name) got a $1,100 pay-off when he lost his construction job in April, but has had to spend nearly all of it on food and other necessities, which are far costlier in Dubai than back home in Pakistan. This week he was huddling outside the airport for a cigarette before a flight to Lahore. “Two years [and] I go home with almost nothing,” he says. Some of his friends are even worse off: they still owe money to the labour brokers who brought them to the Gulf in the first place.

Covid-19 has immobilised the world. Planes are grounded, borders are closed, people are hunkered down at home. Every country has restricted travel because of the coronavirus—issuing more than 65,000 rules in total. Some countries are starting to open up but it will be a long time before people can globetrot as freely as before.

For tourists who have to take a domestic holiday instead of a glamorous foreign one, global immobility is annoying. For would-be migrants, it can be life-shattering. Millions who would have set off to start a new life this year cannot. Workers who might have quadrupled their wages will remain poor. Students who might have stretched their minds on foreign campuses will stay at home.

Tens of millions of migrants who have already moved now face deportation, having lost their job, according to the International Labour Organisation. Millions have gone home to places like the Philippines, India and Ukraine. Millions more are stranded, sometimes in crowded conditions that foster the spread of the virus.

Locals are not always sympathetic. Malaysia, which used to welcome Muslim Rohingya refugees, has started pushing their vessels back into the sea. Italy has stepped up efforts to turn back boatloads of Africans. A Kuwaiti actress suggested that migrant workers, who are 70% of the labour force in Kuwait, be thrown into the desert to free up space in hospitals.

Global remittance flows, which are over three times bigger than foreign aid to poor countries, will fall by 20% this year, predicts the World Bank. Families that used to rely on cash from a migrant son or aunt to see them through hard times are finding that times are suddenly much harder and the flow of cash from abroad has dried up.

Businesses that depend on mobile labour have been hobbled. Pokka Singapore, a drinks-maker, employs about 120 Malaysians who used to commute across the border to Singapore. When the borders closed, more than half decided to remain in Malaysia, says Rieko Shofu, the firm’s boss. She has gone without half her Malaysian workforce for months, with no end in sight.

Immigration to the United States was falling even before the pandemic, thanks to aggressive enforcement, reduced quotas and the eloquence with which Mr Trump tells migrants they are not wanted. The net increase in the foreign-born population was a mere 200,000 in 2017-18, down from over 1m in 2013-14. Mr Trump seems eager to lower that number to zero.

In June he issued a “Proclamation Suspending Entry of Aliens Who Present a Risk to the US Labour Market Following the Coronavirus Outbreak”. It froze four types of visa for the rest of the year: H-1Bs (for highly skilled workers); H-2Bs (for less-skilled workers); J visas, for au pairs, temporary summer workers and some academics; and L visas, for professionals who are moved within the same company.

With every word, they drop knowledge

These new rules, combined with a neartotal shutdown of visa offices, will destroy American jobs, not create them. Holders of H-1B visas mostly work in information technology, where there is a skills shortage. Adam Ozimek of Upwork, a freelancing platform, estimates that the use of IT to enable remote working has reduced the risk of job losses by between a third and a half. And a new paper by Britta Glennon of the Wharton School finds that when America restricts H-1B visas, multinationals do not hire more Americans. They shift operations to Canada, India and China.

Curbing the flow of talent will constrict economic growth. Consider the baffling decision to stop intra-company transfers. Multinationals routinely bring in key managers or technicians from abroad to solve bottlenecks. If they cannot do this, their businesses are less likely to succeed—so they will be less likely to invest in America at all. “About 80% of my portfolio consists of at least one founder who has immigrant roots,” says Joydeep Bhattacharyya, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. “Many have started outside the United States, and then the entrepreneur has moved over, employing a lot of American workers. This year it’s completely stopped. No matter how well they’re doing, they can’t come.”

Banning au pairs won’t create jobs for Americans, either. On the contrary: by providing cheap child care, au pairs make it easier for American parents to go out to work. Families that couldn’t afford a nanny can often afford an au pair because part of the au pair’s compensation is a place to stay and a chance to learn English.

Jason Patwell, a defence contractor, is a single father of three boys, one of whom has special needs. He was aghast when he realised that an au pair would not be coming. “I would love to say I have a back-up plan, but I don’t. I can throw money at the problem, and go into debt. I’ll survive until the end of the summer,” he says.

In worse-off countries, where the state lacks the cash to cushion the economic shock of covid-19, the debate about migration is even more fraught. Consider South Africa, where xenophobia was common, sometimes lethally so, even before the pandemic. Like America, South Africa shares a long, porous land border with a large continent where wages are much lower. Workers and traders flock there from all over Africa. The World Bank estimates that each one creates on average two jobs for natives, because migrants import skills, start businesses and spend money. But most South Africans think otherwise. They are nearly twice as likely to say that immigrants are a burden than to say they make the country stronger, says a Pew poll. (In America, those figures are reversed.)

One of the first things South Africa’s government did to fight covid-19 was to build a 40km fence on the border with Zimbabwe. It has more holes than a bagel warehouse. A local farmer calls it “a complete farce”. It would not be much of a public-health measure in any case. Covid-19 has largely entered South Africa by air, from Europe, and is circulating widely.

In March a minister announced that foreign-owned shops, which are the only outlets in many areas and are disproportionally owned by Ethiopians and Somalis, would have to close. Locals were forced to travel miles to buy groceries, which helped spread the virus. Enforcement was relaxed in April, but the hassles did not end.

When the offices that issue permits were closed, the government promised that all expiring permits would automatically be extended, first until July 31st, then until October 31st. However, police and soldiers have allegedly detained and demanded bribes from foreigners with out-of-date papers. A few Zimbabweans got on privately organised repatriation buses. Upon leaving South Africa, some were banned from returning for five years, despite promises to the contrary. An overhaul of immigration laws is due later this year—to be drafted by securocrats, not economists.

Some countries may emerge from the pandemic more open to migration. In Japan covid-19 may have spurred the government to make its pro-immigration policies more explicit. The country is ageing and needs young foreigners to clean hotels and staff shops. The polite fiction was that many of these foreign workers were “trainees”, learning skills to bring back home.

Got a lot farther by working a lot harder

But from April the government ditched the requirement that these “trainees” stick with the firm that sponsored their visa. It did not want to deport migrants who had lost jobs in one sector (eg hotels) when others (eg hospitals) were crying out for them. So it announced that they could switch employers. By doing so, it has dropped the pretence that the trainee programme is about anything more than coping with Japan’s own labour shortage, argues Menju Toshihiro of the Japan Centre for International Exchange, a non-profit. Indeed, migrant workers are so valuable that calls to exclude them from the government’s covid-19 stimulus package fell on deaf ears.



Do they know what you overcame?

In Britain anti-immigration sentiment peaked around the time of the Brexit referendum of 2016, but has since subsided. Many who voted to leave the EU because they thought there was too much migration now feel Britain has taken back control of its borders. In the wake of covid-19, views of immigration will continue to mollify, predicts Jonathan Portes of King’s College London. A recent decision to extend residence rights to up to 3m Hong Kongers passed without fuss. Under a proposed points-based system, EU nationals will find it harder to work in the UK, and few workers from anywhere will be admitted if they make less than £25,600 ($33,231) a year. But the rules will be looser for health workers. And voters have noticed that many migrants who make less than £25,600 have been indispensable of late. “Care workers, bus drivers and supermarket staff all fulfil essential functions, and it is far from obvious that there will be public support for an immigration system that excludes them all in favour of relatively junior bankers,” writes Mr Portes.

In America, for all Mr Trump’s fist-waving, the share of people who think that illegal immigration is a “very big problem” has fallen markedly since the pandemic began, from 43% last year to 28% in June. This could be because the influx has dried up, or because, compared with covid-19 itself, nothing seems like a “very big problem”. The country is divided. A new Economist/YouGov poll finds Americans roughly evenly split between wanting immigration to resume after the pandemic at the same pace as before or faster (40%) versus slower or remaining frozen (42%).

Still, the inability of populist leaders such as Mr Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro to cope with covid-19 could cost them their jobs—and thereby usher in a less drawbridge-up type of government. The Economist’s prediction model gives Joe Biden about a nine-in-ten chance of winning the American presidency in November. He would clearly be different. He says “Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants.” He could immediately revoke Mr Trump’s executive orders and stop separating migrant children from their parents. He vows to promote laws to increase the number of skilled migrants, create an easier path to citizenship and let cities with labour shortages petition for more migrants.

Covid-19 has shown that the freedom to migrate, which was always constrained, can be cancelled at will when people are scared. Consider Subha Nawer Pushpita’s experiences. She is a Bangladeshi studying computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. America was built by people like her: immigrants at MIT have won more Nobel prizes than China. So she was gobsmacked to learn, on July 6th, that she might be deported. The government said that foreigners at American universities who take only remote classes would have to leave the country.

Eighteen states sued to have the rule scrapped. The week after, it was. “I felt incredibly relieved and excited. I called my mom and I was shouting,” recalls Ms Pushpita. She will be able to study. But many others won’t. On July 24th the Trump administration said that new foreign students who have not yet reached America will be barred if their classes are taught remotely. “As long as he’s in office, something else will pop up,” sighs Ms Pushpita.




新加坡主权财富基金淡马锡(Temasek)的斯蒂芬•福肖(Stephen Forshaw)表示，在投资一家企业之前，你需要“能够在工厂里走动”，并且“切实验证你在PowerPoint演示文稿中所读到的内容”。现在，如果你还没有做到，你就做不到。
这种流行病还可能伤害非法移民。各国政府为追踪covid-19的传播而采用的一些监视工具可能会持续更久，使暗中工作更加困难。在中国，举个最极端的例子，商场和地铁经常拒绝那些手机上没有显示自己健康的应用程序的人进入，没有正式地址的人是无法进入的。非洲中国网的罗伯托·卡斯蒂略写道:“没有纸几乎是不可能生存的。”
在其他方面,然而,大流行可能使人们对移民友好,他们中的很多人都冒着生命危险做重要的工作在金融危机期间(见图表1)。在富裕国家卫生服务功能无法离开它们(见表2),大约一半的医生在澳大利亚和以色列是在国外出生的。2018年，移民占美国人口的14%，医生的29%。将来研制出疫苗的那种医学研究，有赖于来自世界各地最有才华的团队聚在一起合作。在美国，大约40%的医学和生命科学家是在国外出生的。牛津疫苗小组在7月公布了有希望的疫苗试验结果，其中包括来自世界各地的科学家。
智囊团移民政策研究所的Doris Meissner观察到，移民也做了很大一部分工作，这些工作“使我们其他人能够在家安全地工作”。他们种植粮食(42%的美国农场工人是外国出生的)，送货(18%的工业卡车司机)和楼层消毒(47%的酒店服务员和25%的门卫)。超过一半的美国科技巨头是由移民或他们的子女创立的。这其中包括Zoom、亚马逊(Amazon)和谷歌，如果没有它们的产品，远程工作将会很棘手。
在covid-19盛行的情况下，移民政策在任何地方都不是首要议程。但它正在冒泡。欧洲似乎对穿越地中海的移民更加敌视。在澳大利亚，反对党工党的移民发言人表示，该国应该摆脱对“廉价”外国工人的“懒惰”依赖，这些人抢走了“澳大利亚人可以做的工作”。

在富裕国家中，这场辩论在美国上演得最为戏剧化。早在新冠肺炎被发现之前，特朗普就将移民与细菌联系在一起。他谈到了“巨大的传染性疾病……正越过与墨西哥的边境”。强硬派顾问斯蒂芬•米勒(Stephen Miller)长期以来一直认为，公共卫生可以为将它们拒之门外提供法律依据。冠状病毒爆发后，特朗普制定了一系列限制措施。
他禁止来自中国的外国游客。这并没有保护美国，因为美国人可以从covid-19热点地区自由返回家园。尽管如此，特朗普还是称赞了自己的果断。“我禁止了中国，”他经常重复说。
甚至在流感大流行之前，美国的移民数量就已经在下降，这要归功于积极的执法、减少的配额以及特朗普对移民说他们不需要的雄辩。外国出生人口的净增长从2013-14年的逾100万下降到2017-18年的区区20万。特朗普似乎急于将这一数字降至零。
今年6月，他发布了一项“公告，在冠状病毒爆发后，暂停对美国劳动力市场构成风险的外国人入境”。在今年余下的时间里，它冻结了四种类型的签证:H-1Bs(高技能工人签证);H-2Bs(针对低技能工人);J签证，给互惠生、临时暑期工人和一些学者;L签证，适用于在同一家公司工作的专业人员。
每说一个字，他们就失去知识
这些新规定，加上签证办公室几乎全部关闭，将会摧毁而不是创造美国的就业机会。持有H-1B签证的人大多在信息技术行业工作，而这一行业存在技能短缺问题。自由职业平台Upwork的亚当•奥兹梅克(Adam Ozimek)估计，利用IT实现远程工作将失业风险降低了三分之一到一半。沃顿商学院(Wharton School)的布丽塔•格伦农(Britta Glennon)的一篇新论文发现，当美国限制H-1B签证时，跨国公司不会雇佣更多的美国人。他们将业务转移到加拿大、印度和中国。
限制人才流动将限制经济增长。想想阻止公司内部调动的令人困惑的决定吧。跨国公司通常从国外引进关键管理人员或技术人员来解决瓶颈。如果他们做不到这一点，他们的生意就不太可能成功——所以他们根本就不太可能在美国投资。硅谷风险投资家乔伊迪普•巴塔查里亚(Joydeep Bhattacharyya)表示:“在我的投资组合中，大约80%的创始人都至少有一位有移民血统。”他说:“许多企业家在美国以外的地方开始创业，然后这些企业家就转移到美国，雇用了很多美国工人。今年它完全停止了。不管他们做得多好，他们都不能来。”
禁止互惠生也不会为美国人创造就业机会。相反，通过提供廉价的托儿服务，帮佣让美国父母更容易外出工作。那些请不起保姆的家庭通常也能请得起互惠生，因为互惠生的部分报酬是提供住宿和学习英语的机会。
国防承包商杰森·帕特韦尔(Jason Patwell)是三个男孩的单亲父亲，其中一个有特殊需要。当他意识到互惠生不来的时候，他惊呆了。“我想说我有后备计划，但我没有。我可以用金钱解决问题，然后负债。我能活到夏末，”他说。
在贫穷国家，政府缺乏资金来缓冲covid-19带来的经济冲击，关于移民的辩论更加令人担忧。以南非为例，即使在大流行之前，仇外情绪也很普遍，有时甚至是致命的。与美国一样，南非与一个工资低得多的大陆有着漫长而多孔的陆地边界。工人和商人从非洲各地涌向那里。世界银行(World Bank)估计，由于移民进口技能、创业和消费，每一个移民项目平均能为本国人创造两份工作。但大多数南非人并不这么认为。皮尤(Pew)的一项民意调查显示，认为移民是一种负担的人几乎是认为移民使美国更强大的人的两倍。(在美国，这一数字正好相反。)


它的洞比百吉饼仓库还多。一位当地农民称之为“彻头彻尾的闹剧”。无论如何，这都不会是一项公共卫生措施。Covid-19主要是通过飞机从欧洲进入南非的，目前正在广泛传播。
但从4月份开始，政府取消了要求这些“受训者”必须留在为他们提供签证的公司的规定。它不想驱逐那些在一个部门(如酒店)失去工作的移民，而其他部门(如医院)正迫切需要他们。因此，政府宣布他们可以更换雇主。日本国际交流中心(一家非营利性机构)的Menju Toshihiro认为，通过这样做，日本就不再假装培训计划只是为了解决日本自身的劳动力短缺。事实上，外来务工人员是如此的宝贵，以至于把他们排除在政府的新冠肺炎刺激计划之外的呼声都被置若罔闻。
他们知道你克服了什么吗?
在英国，反移民情绪在2016年脱欧公投期间达到顶峰，但此后有所减弱。许多人投票离开欧盟，因为他们认为有太多移民，现在他们觉得英国已经夺回了对其边境的控制。伦敦大学国王学院的乔纳森•波特斯预测，在covid-19爆发后，对移民的看法将继续缓和。最近一项将香港居民居留权延长至300万的决定顺利通过。根据一项拟议的积分制，欧盟国民将发现在英国工作更加困难，无论来自哪里，年收入低于2.56万英镑(合3.3231万美元)的工人都不会被允许入境。但是对卫生工作者的规定会比较宽松。选民们也注意到，许多收入低于2.56万英镑的移民近来是不可或缺的。波特斯写道:“医护人员、公交司机和超市员工都履行着基本职能，如果移民体系将他们全部排除在外，而支持相对初级的银行家，公众是否会支持这一体系，还远不明显。”
在美国，尽管特朗普先生挥舞着拳头，认为非法移民是一个“非常大的问题”的人数比例自疫情开始以来已经显著下降，从去年的43%下降到今年6月的28%。这可能是因为流入的病毒已经停止，或者因为与covid-19本身相比，没有什么看起来是一个“非常大的问题”。国家分裂了。一项新的经济学家/YouGov民意调查发现，美国人希望在疫情爆发后恢复移民的速度与之前相同或更快(40%)和希望移民速度放缓或保持不变(42%)之间大致各占一半。

《经济学人》的预测模型显示，乔•拜登(Joe Biden)赢得11月美国总统大选的几率约为90%。他显然会有所不同。他说，“特朗普对我们的价值观和移民国家的历史发动了无情的攻击。他可以立即撤销特朗普的行政命令，停止让移民子女与父母分离。他誓言要推动法律，以增加技术移民的数量，创造更容易获得公民身份的途径，并让劳动力短缺的城市申请更多移民。

18个州提起诉讼要求废除这一规定。一星期后，它是。我感到无比的轻松和兴奋。我给妈妈打了电话，然后大喊大叫，”普什皮塔回忆说。她将能够学习。但其他许多国家不会。7月24日，特朗普政府表示，如果远程授课，尚未抵达美国的外国新生将被禁止入学。普什皮塔叹息道:“只要他还在执政，其他的事情就会出现。”
