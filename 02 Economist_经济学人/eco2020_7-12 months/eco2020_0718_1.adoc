Why business in Hong Kong *should be worried*

A new national-security law *is not the only threat*

新的国家安全法并不是唯一的威胁

He *also ruled that* Hong Kong *was no longer* a separate economic entity (*justifying*  证明…正确（或正当、有理） different treatment from the rest of China).

The mantra of establishment types is that this law is working to “stabilise” Hong Kong. They mean that, by constraining political and civil strife, the city is now reverting to its age-old role as a business hub. Officials point out how the Hang Seng index surged after the law’s promulgation on June 30th. Since then, they note, daily stockmarket turnover has been the highest in more than two years.

It is not surprising that they use such indicators. Business interests are deeply enmeshed in Hong Kong’s political structures—even more so now than in British colonial days. The Basic Law, the mini-constitution that Hong Kong adopted at the time of its handover to China in 1997, gives companies a big share of the vote in the 1,200-strong committee that chooses the chief executive. Nearly half of Legco’s seats are “functional” constituencies set aside for commercial and other special interests. The chief executive’s advisory body, the Executive Council, is stuffed with representatives from business and finance.

Since China took control of the city, businesspeople have had good reason to talk up its prospects. The territory has continued to be a vital intermediary between China and the world. In Hong Kong, mainland companies enjoy access to hard currency, free of the capital controls that shackle them at home. International investors have benefited from Hong Kong’s sound legal, monetary and regulatory systems. Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s pre-eminent international financial powerhouse has remained nearly unassailable. Its abundance of financial, legal, accounting and other professional expertise has encouraged more than 1,500 companies to put their regional headquarters in the city.

Strikingly, neither last year’s turmoil nor this year’s pandemic dented Hong Kong’s pre-eminence. In November Alibaba raised nearly $13bn in a secondary listing in Hong Kong. JD.com, another e-commerce giant, followed last month, raising $3.9bn. Officials and financial executives talk of a coming listings bonanza. Hong Kong is even a beneficiary in this regard of Sino-American tensions. Among other things, American moves to tighten auditing procedures make listings in New York harder for Chinese firms.

Yet business is also a source of social tension. Yes, finance and related services remain globally competitive, accounting for about a quarter of the economy. But finance employs relatively few people compared with less competitive services, and pushes up prices for everyone in the territory. In the absence of other vibrant sectors, property prices have grown out of kilter with most Hong Kongers’ incomes. Government efforts to foster high tech, the arts, medical tourism and even wine trading have produced little. In the time it took Alibaba, JD.com and a dozen other Chinese startups to emerge as giants, no new Hong Kong company has achieved the same.

This is a consequence of the government’s close ties with business. Nearly every major business sector is in the hands of one or another of the city’s handful of established property conglomerates. These stifle competition and keep the cost of property (the world’s most expensive) and other basic services prohibitively high.

The government should years ago have broken the dominance of such family-owned groups. And it should have done much more to build new public housing. Instead, writes Simon Cartledge for Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy, because these firms are over-represented in government, “Hong Kong’s single biggest disincentive to risk-taking and entrepreneurship—its high costs, especially for property—cannot be tackled.” That is why the back-to-business message is unlikely to resonate with ordinary Hong Kongers.

The security law, meanwhile, may generate problems for business. Admittedly, many executives say they are confident that street turmoil on last year’s scale is unlikely to erupt again, and that the stockmarket will keep booming. Many local firms say they support the new law. But some dare not voice their anxiety. A new survey of members of the American Chamber of Commerce is revealing: 76% of respondents said they were somewhat or extremely worried about the legislation.

In private, concerns are more fully aired. Hong Kong is a world leader in commercial arbitration, a niche the government has actively promoted. Yet leading experts in this field fear that clients with mainland counterparties will, however irrationally, think that the law undermines Hong Kong’s impartiality and will stipulate a seat for possible disputes other than Hong Kong. Singapore is vigorously recruiting Hong Kong arbitration lawyers.

Foreign media companies are also alarmed. The law requires tightened management of them and allows their communications to be seized or intercepted. This week the New York Times said it would move its digital operations, about a third of its Hong Kong staff, to South Korea.

Tech and social-media companies have the biggest worries. The law demands they take down material in breach of national security, or provide user information demanded by police investigating national-security cases. Alarm at having to do this has led Facebook, Twitter and others to pause all consideration of all requests from the government. Providers of cloud services, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, are also under pressure to agree to demands from regulators for customers’ banking records. They too are stalling, but that can only be a stopgap. If executives are not to face fines or prison, firms must either comply or leave. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act only sharpens their dilemma. Helping America to enforce sanctions would violate the security law. Not doing so would incur American penalties.

Much as it would like to reassure firms, the government is failing to do so. The Economist asked the commerce secretary, Edward Yau, what measures would be taken against the media under the security law. He offered no details. Perhaps local officials are as much in the dark about the central government’s specific intentions as anyone. Asked whether the departure of Google, Facebook and Twitter would count as a bad day in the office for him, Mr Yau said that over time the picture would become clearer for tech companies when courts give rulings related to the security law. He added that it was not the job of a light-touch government to pick which business sectors should prosper and which should fail. Yet fostering tech is one of the government’s priorities, while the threat to the sector is the opposite of light-handed.

For the long term, the security law introduces a new and potentially ominous dimension into the business-political nexus. Under it, Luo Huining, the head of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong has been appointed as commissar to “advise” on national security. But he also oversees a secretive portfolio of investments in Hong Kong encompassing over 300 properties and the largest bookseller and publisher. If you think that Hong Kong’s anti-corruption body, which reports to the chief executive, would have no qualms about going hard after irregularities within that Communist Party-controlled empire, think again. Mr Luo is one of China’s most powerful men. Carrie Lam, the chief executive, is fast becoming just another small-town mayor.

== The darkness behind

Why business in Hong Kong should be worried

A new national-security law is not the only threat

Jul 18th 2020 | HONG KONG


JUST OVER two weeks after its enactment, Hong Kong’s national-security law—a Leninist set of measures designed in Beijing and clamped on top of a legal system hitherto admired for its respect for individual rights—looms ever larger over the territory. In response, on July 14th, President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. This authorises sanctions on those involved in “extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom”, as well as on financial firms that knowingly do business with them. He also ruled that Hong Kong was no longer a separate economic entity justifying different treatment from the rest of China.

The act will sharpen differences between America and China, and give Hong Kong’s Communist Party overlords an excuse to divine foreign meddling in every corner of the territory’s life. They already spy enemies in many places. They have denounced the recent holding of informal primary elections, in which 610,000 Hong Kongers helped choose candidates fielded by anti-establishment parties for polls for the Legislative Council, or Legco, in September. They accused those who conducted the unprecedented exercise of harbouring “evil intentions”, including the use of Hong Kong as a base for “subversion” and foreign “infiltration”. These relate to crimes that, along with sedition and terrorism, are covered by the security law.

The mantra of establishment types is that this law is working to “stabilise” Hong Kong. They mean that, by constraining political and civil strife, the city is now reverting to its age-old role as a business hub.

背后的黑暗
为什么香港的企业应该感到担忧
新的国家安全法并不是唯一的威胁
2020年7月18日|香港
在颁布两周后，香港的国家安全法——一套由北京设计的列宁主义的措施-- 在香港的影响力越来越大。迄今因尊重个人权利, 而备受推崇的香港的法律体系, 被其束缚住了。作为回应，7月14日，唐纳德·特朗普总统签署了《香港自治法案》。该法案授权对那些参与“扼杀香港自由”的人，以及故意与这些人做生意的金融公司, 进行制裁。他还裁定，香港不再是一个独立的经济实体，因此不应受到与中国其他地区不同的待遇。

该法案将加剧美国和中国之间的差异，并给香港的共产党统治者一个借口，以预测外国干涉香港生活的每一个角落。他们已经在许多地方暗中监视敌人。他们谴责了最近举行的非正式预选。在这次预选中，61万名香港人帮助挑选了由反建制政党派出的候选人，这些候选人将在9月份参加立法会的选举。他们指责那些进行了史无前例的藏匿“邪恶意图”的人，包括利用香港作为“颠覆”和外国“渗透”的基地。这些罪行同煽动叛乱和恐怖主义一样，都属于安全法的范围。
当权人士的口头禅是，这部法律正致力于“稳定”香港。他们的意思是，通过限制政治和内乱，这座城市正在恢复其作为商业中心的古老角色。官员们指出，6月30日新法颁布后，恒生指数飙升。他们指出，自那以后，股市的日成交量达到了两年多来的最高水平。
他们使用这样的指标并不奇怪。商业利益已经深深地融入了香港的政治结构中——甚至比英国殖民时期还要深。香港1997年回归中国时通过的迷你宪法《基本法》(Basic Law)赋予了企业在1200人组成的行政长官选举委员会中的很大一部分投票权。立法会近一半的席位是为商业和其他特殊利益集团预留的“功能性”选区。行政长官的顾问机构行政会议由商界和金融界的代表组成。
自从中国控制了这座城市，商人们有充分的理由谈论它的前景。该领土继续是中国与世界之间的重要媒介。在香港，内地企业可以获得硬通货，摆脱了束缚它们的国内资本管制。国际投资者受益于香港健全的法律、货币和监管体系。香港作为亚洲首屈一指的国际金融中心的地位，几乎一直是不容置疑的。它丰富的金融、法律、会计和其他专业知识鼓励了1500多家公司将它们的地区总部设在上海。
引人注目的是，无论是去年的动荡还是今年的疫情，都没有削弱香港的卓越地位。去年11月，阿里巴巴在香港二次上市，筹资近130亿美元。另一家电商巨头京东(JD.com)上月紧随其后，融资39亿美元。政府官员和金融业高管都在谈论即将到来的上市热潮。香港甚至是中美紧张关系的受益者。除此之外，美国收紧审计程序的举措使得中国公司更难在纽约上市。
然而，商业也是社会紧张的一个根源。是的，金融及相关服务业仍在全球具有竞争力，约占中国经济的四分之一。但与竞争力较弱的服务业相比，金融业雇佣的员工相对较少，并推高了香港所有人的价格。在缺乏其他充满活力的行业的情况下，房地产价格已经与大多数香港人的收入不平衡。政府培育高科技、艺术、医疗旅游甚至葡萄酒贸易的努力收效甚微。在阿里巴巴、京东(JD.com)和其他十多家中国初创企业成为巨头的那段时间里，没有一家新的香港公司取得了同样的成就。
这是政府与商业密切联系的结果。几乎每一个主要的商业领域都掌握在香港为数不多的几家成熟的房地产企业集团的手中。这抑制了竞争，并使房地产(世界上最昂贵的)和其他基本服务的成本高得令人望而却步。


在建造新的公共住房方面，政府应该做得更多。相反，咨询公司Gavekal Dragonomics的Simon Cartledge写道，由于这些公司在政府中的比例过高，“香港对冒险和创业最大的阻碍是高昂的成本，尤其是房地产成本，无法解决。”这就是为什么回归商业的信息不太可能引起普通香港人的共鸣。
科技和社交媒体公司的担忧最大。该法要求他们删除违反国家安全的内容，或提供警方调查国家安全案件时要求的用户信息。由于政府不得不这么做，Facebook、Twitter和其他网站都暂停了对政府的所有请求的考虑。包括亚马逊(Amazon)、谷歌和微软(Microsoft)在内的云服务提供商也面临着压力，要求它们同意监管机构对客户银行记录的要求。他们也在拖延，但这只能是权宜之计。如果高管们不会面临罚款或牢狱之灾，企业必须要么遵守规定，要么离开。《香港自治法》只会加剧他们的困境。帮助美国执行制裁将违反安全法。不这样做将招致美国的惩罚。
虽然政府很想安抚公司，但它做不到这一点。《经济学人》问商务部长邱腾华，根据安全法将采取什么措施来打击媒体。他没有提供任何细节。也许地方官员和任何人一样不清楚中央政府的具体意图。当被问及谷歌、Facebook和Twitter的离开是否会被视为他在办公室里的糟糕一天时，丘德威表示，随着时间的推移，当法院做出与安全法有关的裁决时，科技公司的情况会变得更加清楚。他补充称，选择哪些商业部门应该繁荣、哪些应该失败，不是一个温和型政府的职责。然而，培育科技产业是政府的首要任务之一，而该行业面临的威胁则与之相反。
从长期来看，安全法为政商关系引入了一个新的、可能是不祥的维度。根据该决议，中央政府驻香港联络办公室主任罗会宁被任命为政委，就国家安全问题提供“建议”。但他也在香港监管着一个秘密的投资组合，包括300多处房产和最大的书商和出版商。如果你认为香港的反腐机构(向行政长官汇报)会毫不犹豫地对这个共产党控制的帝国内部的违规行为采取严厉措施，那你就得三思了。罗是中国最有权势的人之一。香港特首林郑月娥(Carrie Lam)正迅速成为另一个小城的市长。
