== Elites in Beijing see America in decline, hastened by Trump


But they are not sure whether it would suit China for Trump to be re-elected

Jun 11th 2020 |


WHOM WOULD China prefer as America’s next president? That is a hard question, without an uplifting answer. In elite circles in Beijing, both President Donald Trump and his rival, Joe Biden, a former vice-president, are spoken of with distrust and condescension. Rather unusually, both candidates are known quantities. Each man has spent many hours with President Xi Jinping. During the first term of the Obama administration, when Mr Xi was heir-apparent to the leadership of China with the formal rank of vice-president, Mr Biden, as his opposite number, was tasked with taking his measure. Visiting China in 2011, Mr Biden hailed their numerous meetings in various countries and their “mutual respect”. Mr Trump has gone further, calling Mr Xi his “very, very good friend”. Few in Beijing are fooled. Mr Trump and Mr Biden may share a capacity for talking (and talking) in pursuit of a deal. But Mr Xi’s grim, security-first worldview leaves little room for foreign friendships, let alone with garrulous Americans.

Chinese disdain combines the political with the personal. In the unmarked villas, private dining rooms and scholarly retreats where—when it suits them—well-connected Chinese sometimes offer opinions to foreigners, Mr Trump is called ignorant, erratic and tiresome, but not without his uses. He is praised for an apparent indifference to ideology. He is complimented for his reluctance to condemn Chinese repression in such places as Xinjiang. People familiar with the thinking of Chinese generals assert, approvingly, that Mr Trump dislikes military adventures abroad.

Chinese leaders initially mistook Mr Trump for a pragmatic tycoon, a type they have met before. Now he is called a narcissist who cares only about his own interests, starting with his re-election. That cynicism informs China’s response to the trade war unleashed by Mr Trump, with wary but bipartisan support from members of Congress and some American business lobbies. Plenty of American businessfolk have swallowed qualms about Mr Trump’s tactics. They were glad to see him press China over its unfair market rules and industrial policies that promote local champions at the expense of foreign firms. Detecting that Mr Trump was more interested in China’s money than in making China change its ways, officials in Beijing agreed on a “phase one” trade deal built around purchases of American commodities. China has kept that deal alive, with state companies buying shiploads of soyabeans and other goods even as the two governments trade angry words about each other’s handling of covid-19, among other issues. China has yet to fulfil its threat to name American firms as “unreliable entities” ripe for punitive treatment, even after the Trump administration said it would put sanctions on China for imposing a national-security law on Hong Kong. Mr Trump’s supporters would doubtless call China’s caution a tribute to their president’s tariff-happy toughness. Maybe. But China is also buying itself time. Satisfying Mr Trump has effectively parked America’s bipartisan demands for structural reforms. That does not make Chinese elites relaxed, though. They fret that Mr Trump has been “kidnapped” by the truly ideological China hawks who surround him.

As for Mr Biden, in Beijing he is called a member of the former ruling establishment that saw economic interdependence with China as a source of stability, not danger. Mr Biden was a player in Obama-era campaigns to seek China’s help in tackling climate change and other global challenges. Yet, in China, there is strikingly little nostalgia for those days. Some grumble that such engagement rested on a mistaken American belief that China would converge politically with the West as it grew richer. Others recall how American politicians bragged that democracies had a creative edge that autocratic China would always lack. That is certainly a favourite Biden line, as in 2013 when he told Chinese students applying for visas at America’s embassy in Beijing that “innovation can only occur when you can breathe free.” The view in China is that its best scientists and tech firms are busy disproving such boasts, tipping America into a crisis of confidence and anti-China hysteria.

Just as bipartisan opinion in Washington has coalesced around alarm at China’s rise, an elite consensus has emerged in the Chinese capital. Especially in this summer of pandemic and street protests, America is called a nation in decline: a rich country too divided, selfish and racist to keep its citizens safe. Chinese elites see Mr Trump as a symptom and an agent of that decline. State media long refrained from direct attacks on Mr Trump. Not now. The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, this month reported that Chinese netizens mockingly call him Chuan Jianguo, or “Build-up-the-country Trump”. Their joke, that he is a double-agent wrecking America to make China strong, prompts lines like “Comrade Chuan Jianguo, don’t blow your cover!” Does such scorn mean that China wants Mr Trump re-elected? There, elites are divided. At root, their debates turn on two questions: is American decline irreversible, and would its acceleration suit China just now?

Two devils, both known

In national-security circles, many see advantages to four more years of turbulence, with Mr Trump weakening democracy at home and repelling allies in Asia and beyond. In contrast, elites focused on the economy fear the premature collapse of a global trading order that has profited China mightily. That prods some to hanker for Mr Biden. Such people think of him as a moderate who might slow economic decoupling, giving China time to diversify and become more self-reliant. Still another camp holds that America’s next government, of whichever party, will be filled with officials bent on keeping China down, but that Mr Biden’s team will be more competent, and thus more dangerous. Many Biden-sceptics in China note, with alarm, how the Democrat has taken to chiding Mr Trump for being soft on Chinese human-rights abuses. All camps are united by a bleakly defensive mood. Whoever becomes America’s next president, China does not expect to be friends.

== The shifting ground 词汇解说

(eco 2020-6-13 / United States / Police reform: The shifting ground)

[In America] protests *have already brought* policy *changes*

Congress 国会，议会, cities and states *have all suggested changes* since George Floyd’s killing

Jun 11th 2020 | WASHINGTON, DC


FOR YEARS, reformers 改革者；改良者；改造者 *have advocated* 拥护；支持；提倡 a host of policies to make police more accountable to the people they serve, to little avail. But over the past two weeks, police have made better cases for reform than advocates ever could by brutalising journalists and peaceful protesters in broad daylight. Across America the political ground has shifted, as legislators long reluctant to take on the police have started to act.

On June 8th House Democrats unveiled a sweeping reform bill, which would, among other things, make prosecuting and suing police easier, create a national registry of police-misconduct complaints, mandate more extensive data collection, ban chokeholds for federal officers and no-knock warrants in federal drug cases (and require state and local agencies which want federal grant money to do the same) and limit the transfer of military equipment to police. Democrats plan to bring the bill up for a vote by the end of June.

Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, say they are working on their own reform proposal. Tim Scott, the Senate’s lone black Republican and a longtime advocate for police reform, proposed requiring states to report data on no-knock warrants and deadly use of force and increasing funding for body cameras and for hiring “officer candidates who have racial and ethnic characteristics similar to their community”.

While legislators in Washington talk, some in cities and states have acted (as they should: most of America’s 18,000 law-enforcement agencies are locally governed). Many police departments have banned or restricted chokeholds and “carotid restraints”—the neck-compression technique that killed George Floyd—though without clear consequences the bans risk being hortatory and ultimately ignored.

The New York Police Department has banned chokeholds since 1993, and that did not stop officer Daniel Pantaleo from choking Eric Garner to death in 2014. So on June 8th New York’s legislature created the crime of “aggravated strangulation”, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, for officers whose chokehold “or similar restraint” kills or seriously injures someone.

New York is also poised to pass bills creating an investigative office to look into deaths caused by police officers, requiring courts to publish racial and demographic data on low-level offenders, requiring state-police to wear cameras and repealing a statute that shielded officers’ disciplinary records from the public. Washington, DC’s city council has passed measures that forbid the police department from hiring officers with a history of misconduct and require it to disclose the names of any officers who use force.

More radical measures, such as defunding—which in practice can mean something less alarming, like rethinking how police departments function and redirecting some of their budgets—are also getting a hearing. Minneapolis’s city council vowed to disband the city’s police department, though how, when and what might replace it remain unclear. And the mayors of Los Angeles and New York said they would take money from police budgets for social-service programmes.

Along with this flurry of activity have come two important cultural shifts. First, the shares of Americans who support Black Lives Matter and believe that police treat whites better than African-Americans have soared. Second, prosecutors have shed some of their traditional reluctance to go after the police, and have charged officers in several cities who were caught on camera assaulting unarmed people. Perhaps this shift is temporary. Or perhaps a lot of Americans have seen officers act as if they are above the law, and they do not like it.

First, the shares of Americans who support Black Lives Matter and believe that police treat whites better than African-Americans have soared. Second, prosecutors have shed some of their traditional reluctance to go after the police, and have charged officers in several cities who were caught on camera assaulting unarmed people. Perhaps this shift is temporary. Or perhaps a lot of Americans have seen officers act as if they are above the law, and they do not like it.

在美国，抗议活动已经带来了政策的改变
自从乔治·弗洛伊德被杀后，国会、城市和州都建议进行改革
2020年6月11日|华盛顿特区
多年来，改革者们一直在倡导一系列政策，让警察对他们所服务的人民更加负责，但收效甚微。但在过去的两周里，警察在光天化日之下残暴地对待记者和和平抗议者，这比倡导改革的人更有说服力。随着长期不愿与警方对着干的立法者开始行动，整个美国的政治基础已经发生了变化。
6月8日众议院民主党公布了一项全面的改革法案,这将,除此之外,简化起诉,起诉警察,创建一个国家注册警察不当行为的投诉,要求更广泛的数据收集、禁止上打起联邦官员和强行闯入权证在联邦毒品案件,要求州和地方机构希望联邦资金来做同样的事),限制向警方军事设备的转移。民主党人计划在6月底之前对该法案进行投票。
与此同时，国会共和党人表示，他们正在制定自己的改革方案。蒂姆·斯科特,参议院的孤独的黑人共和党和长期提倡警察改革提议要求状态报告数据不敲门认股权证和致命的使用武力和增加资金的身体相机和招聘“官候选人有种族和民族的特征类似于他们的社区”。
当华盛顿的立法者们还在谈论的时候，一些城市和州已经采取了行动(正如他们应该做的那样:美国18000个执法机构中的大部分是由地方管理的)。许多警察部门已经禁止或限制了扼颈和“颈动脉限制”(杀死乔治·弗洛伊德的颈动脉限制技术)，尽管这些禁令没有明确的后果，但可能会被当作劝告，最终被忽视。
纽约警察局自1993年开始禁止扼喉，但这并没有阻止丹尼尔·潘塔莱奥(Daniel Pantaleo)警官在2014年掐死埃里克·加纳(Eric Garner)。因此，6月8日，纽约立法机构设立了“严重勒死”罪，对掐住喉咙或类似的勒死“致人死亡或严重伤害”的警官处以15年监禁。
纽约州还准备通过法案，设立一个调查办公室，调查警察造成的死亡，要求法院公布低级违法者的种族和人口数据，要求州警察佩戴摄像头，并废除一项保护警察纪律记录不让公众看到的法规。华盛顿特区的市议会已经通过了一些措施，禁止警察局雇佣有不当行为历史的警官，并要求其公开任何使用暴力的警官的姓名。
更激进的措施，如减少资金——在实践中可能意味着一些不那么令人担忧的事情，如重新思考警察部门如何运作和重新分配他们的一些预算——也得到了关注。明尼阿波里斯市议会誓言解散该市的警察局，但解散的方式、时间和方式仍不清楚。洛杉矶和纽约的市长表示，他们将从警察预算中提取资金用于社会服务项目。
伴随这一热潮而来的是两种重要的文化转变。首先，支持黑人生命重要、认为警察对待白人比非洲裔美国人更好的美国人的比例大幅上升。其次，检察官已经摆脱了传统上不愿追究警察的态度，已经对几个城市的警察提出了指控，这些警察被拍摄到袭击手无寸铁的人。也许这种转变是暂时的。或许很多美国人看到过警察的行为似乎他们凌驾于法律之上，但他们并不喜欢。
