== Central Asian governments do not know how to talk about China

Their citizens are suspicious, but want investment

Jun 4th 2020 |


FOR MILLENNIA fierce horsemen from Central Asia harried the Chinese empire’s flank, often setting the terms of engagement with their giant, settled neighbour to the east. In February an echo rolled out of the past when a horde of whooping riders galloped through the town of At-Bashy in south-central Kyrgyzstan, close to the border with China.

Their target was a planned Chinese logistics centre: a $275m investment in roads, malls and warehouses that was touted as a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a funnel for revived trade along the old silk road and a source of future prosperity for the locality. But the horsemen of the pristine valley were having none of it: they feared their land would be grabbed and jobs would go to imported Chinese. Facing such hostility, the Chinese investors angrily pulled out, leaving politicians in Kyrgyzstan with egg on their faces.

The incident highlights a growing tension between rulers and ruled in the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. China is the chief and sometimes only source of prosperity in the impoverished region. It dominates foreign direct investment as well as commercial and concessionary lending.

When Banyan was last in Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan, a foreign-ministry official explained that in return for copious investment in oilfields, infrastructure and manufacturing, the only explicit demand China makes of his government is for vocal support for China’s territorial integrity (see article). In particular, China’s government wants no objections to its campaign against Muslims in the province of Xinjiang whom it deems “terrorists” out to split the motherland.

If that stricture is met, the money flows. In Kazakhstan Chinese investment underpins nearly a quarter of the country’s oil output. Despite the horsemen’s protests, logistics is one of the few ways tiny Kyrgyzstan can earn foreign exchange apart from gold mining—in which Chinese firms are also involved. Though Turkmenistan shares no border with China, it is about the most China-dependent economy in the world, sending eastward four-fifths of its exports (almost entirely gas via the China-Central Asia pipeline). Exports of gas to China also provide crucial revenue for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

But such dependence on a single power—in deals often murkily struck by the countries’ elites—is not always easy to explain to compatriots. Awkwardly, the notion of self-reliance is at the core of the personality cult surrounding Turkmenistan’s strongman, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. All Central Asian governments fete their independence, after centuries under the Russian and Soviet yoke. The dissonance is another reason, if Central Asia’s authoritarian leaders wanted one, to keep a lid on the press and stifle dissent. Without that, complaints about China would be louder.

Yet still they bubble up. In September several anti-China protests erupted in Kazakhstan, over rumours that dozens of obsolete Chinese factories would be relocated to the country, over accusations of land grabs by Chinese firms, and over China’s repression in Xinjiang, where more than 1m Muslims are detained in camps. A more recent grumble in private conversations is Central Asian regimes’ growing enthusiasm for high-tech surveillance and social-control systems, which China is keen to supply.

The grievances will only grow. Not least, the economic picture is worsening as the covid-19 pandemic has brought a sharp slowdown in Chinese investment and demand. In March China claimed force majeure to start negotiating reduced gas imports from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

Those hostile to Central Asian governments can piggyback on anti-China sentiment. The protests in Kazakhstan last year were cheered on by an exiled oligarch who needles the regime, Mukhtar Ablyazov. In Kyrgyzstan protests near the Chinese border may be stoked by those who feel left out of immense cross-border smuggling rackets involving customs officials and politicians.

And so the tension between the elites’ priorities and those of ordinary Central Asians will persist. It does not help that the unspoken rule in dealings with China, according to Temur Umarov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Moscow, is never to acknowledge there is a problem in the relationship. Even less helpful is rulers’ inability to acknowledge a problem over China in their relationship with the ruled.

== Knot （用绳索等打的）结 happy 词汇说明

( eco 2020.6.6 / Asia / Marriage in Japan: Knot happy )

Covid-19 *spurs* single Japanese *to look for* love

Match-making agencies have received a surge of inquiries

Jun 4th 2020 | SUZUKA, MIE PREFECTURE


HE HAD ALWAYS imagined he would get married someday. Then covid-19 hit. Yuto (not his real name), a 31-year-old hotel employee from the southern city of Kumamoto, found himself confined to his home, alone. He decided to accelerate his wedding plans, and signed up for an online match-making service to find the love of his life—fast.

Yuto is not alone. Since the pandemic broke out, more Japanese singles have been on the hunt for spouses. Sunmarie, a match-making agency, reported a 30% rise in inquiries in April compared with the year before. Both Sunmarie and O-net, a rival agency, have tried to adapt to the times, offering an online rendez-vous service since early April, when the government began curbing gatherings in much of the country. LMO, another firm, offers drive-through meetings, in which singletons can introduce themselves from their cars, in the empty car parks of wedding halls.

Cooped up in their homes alone for an extended period, singles are getting lonely—hence the surge in business for match-makers, explains Amano Kanako of NLI Research Institute, a think-tank. With covid-19 dominating the news, lonely hearts are also increasingly anxious about the future: they want a partner with whom to face the unknown. “Those who vaguely thought about getting married one day are realising that the time is now,” says Kobayashi Jun of Seikei University.

This marks the reversal of a long trend. Marriage has been in decline for decades. More than 1m couples tied the knot each year in the early 1970s, but only 583,000 did last year. This is not just because the proportion of Japanese in their 20s and 30s (the age at which people most commonly wed) has fallen sharply. In 1970 only 2% of men and 3% of women had never married by 50. By 2015 those shares had climbed to 23% and 14%, respectively.

Interest in matrimony also surged after a terrible earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011. Memberships at match-making agencies soared. The steady decline in weddings was interrupted in 2012, when there were 7,000 more than the year before. The nature and scale of the earthquake and pandemic may differ, but their effect on the unmarried has been comparable, says Nagaoka Masamitsu of O-net. “People are stuck at home and have a lot of time to think about their future.”

Yuto from Kumamoto is already thinking about settling down with a 43-year-old Tokyoite he met online two months ago. Yet the rush to the altar (or shrine) may be short-lived. After the spike of 2012, there were 8,200 fewer weddings in 2013.

节快乐
Covid-19促使日本单身人士寻找真爱
婚介机构收到了大量的咨询
2020年6月4日，三重县铃鹿|
他一直幻想着有一天他会结婚。然后covid-19打击。31岁的Yuto(化名)是一名来自日本南部城市熊本的酒店员工，他发现自己被困在家中。他决定加快他的婚礼计划，并注册了一个在线相亲服务，以快速找到他生活中的真爱。
Yuto并不孤单。自大流行爆发以来，越来越多的日本单身人士开始寻找配偶。一家婚介机构Sunmarie报告说，4月份的问询比去年同期增长了30%。Sunmarie和它的竞争对手O-net都在努力适应这个时代，从4月初政府开始在美国大部分地区限制聚会开始，他们就开始提供在线相亲服务。另一家公司LMO提供免下车会议，单身人士可以在他们的车里，在婚礼大厅空无一人的停车场介绍自己。
智囊团NLI研究所的天野加奈子解释说，单身人士长期独自呆在家里，变得越来越孤独——因此媒人生意兴隆。随着新冠肺炎成为新闻头条，孤独的心也越来越担心未来:他们希望有一个伴侣来面对未知。Seikei大学的Kobayashi Jun说:“那些模糊地想过有一天结婚的人意识到现在是时候结婚了。”
这标志着长期趋势的逆转。几十年来，美国的结婚率一直在下降。上世纪70年代初，每年有100多万对新人结婚，而去年只有58.3万对。这不仅仅是因为20多岁和30多岁(人们最常结婚的年龄)的日本人比例急剧下降。1970年，50岁之前，只有2%的男性和3%的女性从未结婚。到2015年，这两家公司的股价分别攀升至23%和14%。
2011年的可怕地震、海啸和核灾难之后，结婚的兴趣也大增。婚介机构的会员人数激增。婚礼数量的持续下降在2012年中断了，当时的婚礼数量比前一年多了7000场。O-net的Nagaoka Masamitsu说，地震和大流行的性质和规模可能不同，但它们对未婚人群的影响是相似的。“人们被困在家里，有很多时间思考自己的未来。”
熊本市的Yuto已经在考虑和他两个月前在网上认识的一个43岁的东京人安定下来。然而，这股涌向祭坛(或神龛)的热潮可能是短暂的。在2012年的高峰之后，2013年的婚礼减少了8200场。
