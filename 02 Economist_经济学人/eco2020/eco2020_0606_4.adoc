How SARS-CoV-2 *causes(v.) disease and death* in covid-19

There *are* direct routes and indirect ones

Jun 6th 2020 |


THE FIRST SET of lungs *felt like* rubber, says Rainer Claus, *so* damaged *that* it was impossible *to imagine* how any amount of oxygen *could get through* them. `主` The lungs in the rest of the ten covid-19 victims that he and his colleagues at the University Medical Centre Augsburg, in Germany, *autopsied* 验尸；尸体解剖 in early April `系` *were* in similarly awful condition.

- autopsy : /ˈɔːtɑːpsi/ n. an official examination of a dead body by a doctor in order to discover the cause of death 验尸；尸体解剖 +
=> 来源于希腊语中由autos(自己)和optos(可见的)组成的复合词autoptes(目击者),经法语autopsie或现代拉丁语autopsia而派生了英语autopsy。 词根词缀： auto-自己(o略) + (-opt-)视,光 + -y名词词尾

This *has been*, for the most part, the story around the world. People *get infected with* SARS-CoV-2, the virus which *causes* covid-19, by *breathing in* tiny liquid droplets *containing* virus particles. Those particles *gain* entry to the lungs, where they *start reproducing*  复制;繁殖；生育 themselves. If the immune system *does not stop* it -- which it *mostly does* --the virus *causes* so much damage that the lungs *can no longer do their job*, *ending up 最终成为；最后处于 like* those in Augsburg 德国一城市.

But there *are* other facets （事物的）部分，方面 to the disease *not so easily understood*. It *robs* 抢劫；掠夺；盗取 some of the infected 被感染者 *of* their sense of smell; [in others] the toes 脚趾 or fingers *darken* as if bruised 瘀伤;撞伤；擦伤.

Doctors around the world *are trying to find out* how much these various symptoms *are attributable 可归因于；可能由于 to* direct effects of the virus, *to* secondary effects 副效应；继发效应；次生效应 of the damage it *does* to the lungs, or even, in some cases, *to* the treatments *used* against it. The more of the story they *can disentangle* 理顺，分清，清理出（混乱的论据、想法等）, the better the standard of care *is likely to get*.

- 世界各地的医生都在努力查明，这些不同的症状, 在多大程度上可归因于该病毒的直接影响，或其对肺部造成的次生影响，甚至在某些情况下，归因于针对该病毒的治疗。



For the virus *to attack* a cell, the cell’s surface *needs to be adorned 装饰 with* a protein 蛋白质 (which *plays a role* in the regulation of blood pressure and inflammation 发炎；炎症) *called* angiotensin-converting enzyme 血管紧张素转化酶 2 (ACE2).

=> 来自feast, 节日，盛宴。-oon,大词后缀。引申词义张灯结彩。 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/f/festoon.jpg[100,100]

- 几乎所有住院的病人都有肺炎的症状。肺炎是肺部对各种病毒、细菌和真菌感染的反应的总称。当它们深入肺部时，SARS-CoV-2颗粒在肺泡中找到了一个目标丰富的环境。肺泡是微小的肺泡，像葡萄一样悬挂在肺的支气管分支网络上，排列着用ACE2装饰的细胞。正是在这些囊中，呼吸到肺部的空气中的氧气进入了血液，血液中的二氧化碳进入肺部被呼出。病毒对肺泡内壁细胞的破坏和杀死越多，气体交换就越困难。因此呼吸短促。




In some covid-19 cases, though, this shortness of breath 气促；呼吸浅短 -- a textbook 规范的；标准的;教科书 symptom of pneumonia 肺炎 -- *does not show up* （使）看得见，变得明显，显现出来. Doctors *have got used to 习惯于 seeing* patients with blood-oxygen levels *so* low *that* they should be dizzy 头晕目眩的；眩晕的 or unconscious, but who *show* no sign of respiratory 呼吸的 distress 忧虑；悲伤；痛苦.

Daniel Johnson of the University of Nebraska Medical Centre *says* his theory *is that* SARS-CoV-2 *may be affecting* the nervous system. That it *can do so* in some ways, at least, *is hinted 暗示；透露；示意 at* by the fact that some patients *report* a loss of the sense of smell early on in their infection; there *are* other signs, too. Perhaps the virus *has* an effect on the part of the brain which *tells* the lungs *to work harder* when carbon dioxide *builds up* 加大；加强；增多 in the blood.

- hint : v.  *~ (at sth)* to suggest sth in an indirect way 暗示；透露；示意 +
-> *What are you hinting at*? 你在暗示什么？





Angles of attack

Another possibility *is that* the lungs *are not* the only thing at fault  缺陷；毛病；故障. [In some of these atypical 非典型的；反常的 patients] the perilously  危机四伏地；充满危险地 low blood-oxygen level “*seems to be* out of proportion 不相称；不谐调;不成比例 to the overall injury to the lung,” says Joseph Levitt of the Stanford University Medical Centre. The lungs of covid-19 patients *feel* different, too, he says. Typically, the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia 肺炎 *become* stiffer 更硬的, which *makes* moving(v.) air [in and out of them] *increasingly hard*. The ventilators 通气机；呼吸器 (*on to* which such patients *are put* 穿上；戴上) *pump(v.)用泵（或泵样器官等）输送 in* oxygen under pressure, thus *doing* some of the lungs’ work for them. The lungs of covid-19 patients (with blood-oxygen levels low enough to need a ventilator), though, *are not* so stiff, says Dr Levitt. They *have not exhausted 用完；花光；耗尽;使筋疲力尽；使疲惫不堪 their ability* to do their job. But the job *is not getting done*.

- fault : n. [可数名词] something that is wrong or not perfect with sth; something that is wrong with a machine or system that stops it from working correctly 缺陷；毛病；故障 +

-> *atypical behaviour* 反常行为

- *out of (all) proportion (to sth)* : larger, more serious, etc. in relation to sth than is necessary or appropriate 不相称；不谐调 +
They earn salaries *out of all proportion to their ability*.
他们挣的工资与其能力不相称。

- 另一种可能是, 肺不是唯一有问题的地方。斯坦福大学医学中心的约瑟夫·莱维特说，在一些非典型患者中，危险的低血氧水平“似乎与肺部的整体损伤不成比例”。他说，covid-19患者的肺部感觉也不一样。通常情况下，重症肺炎患者的肺部会变得更加僵硬，使得空气进出肺部变得越来越困难。这些病人依靠戴上呼吸机, 在压力下来泵入氧气，从而为他们的肺做一些工作。Levitt博士说，covid-19患者在血氧水平低到需要使用呼吸机的程度时，肺部并没有那么僵硬。他们没有用尽他们的能力去做他们的工作。但这项工作并没有完成。



Dr Levitt *wonders* 想知道；想弄明白；琢磨 whether the problem *may be* in the blood vessels. ACE2’s role in *looking after* 对…负责；照料；照顾 blood pressure *depends on* its ability *to regulate* signals that *make* blood vessels *constrict （使）紧缩，缩窄 or dilate* 扩大；（使）膨胀，扩张. The way SARS-CoV-2 *binds （使）联合在一起，结合 to* ACE2 *probably makes it less able to take part in* 参与某事 that signalling 发信号；发暗号；示意. Covid-19 *may thus reduce* the amount of oxygen which *gets into* tissues *[not just] by damaging* the lung, *[but also] by narrowing* and *damaging* blood vessels. If so, `主` drugs *to dilate* the blood vessels `谓` *might help*, at least in some cases. `主` *Finding out* what treatment *works best* along those lines 方法；方式, though, `谓` *requires* clinical 临床的；临床诊断的 trials(n.)（对能力、质量、性能等的）试验，试用, says Dr Levitt.

-> The new drug *is undergoing clinical trials*. 这种新药正在进行临床试验。 +
=> The system *was introduced on a trial basis* 基准；准则；方式 for one month. 这个制度已引进试行一个月。


- Levitt博士想知道问题是否出在血管上。ACE2在保护血压方面的作用, 取决于它调节使血管收缩或扩张的信号的能力。SARS-CoV-2与ACE2结合的方式, 可能会降低它参与这一信号传递的能力。因此，Covid-19不仅会损伤肺部，还会使血管收缩和损伤，从而减少进入组织的氧气量。如果是这样的话，扩张血管的药物可能会有所帮助，至少在某些情况下是这样。Levitt博士说，要找出哪种治疗方法在这些方面最有效，还需要进行临床试验。

[In hospitals] the treatment *will normally start with* extra oxygen *supplied through* a nasal 鼻的；与鼻子相关的 cannula （输药等的）套管，插管 (a plastic tube with a prong 叉子齿 for each nostril 鼻孔) and therapy 治疗；疗法 *to combat* 防止；减轻;战斗；与…搏斗 dehydration 脱水: patients *have typically had a fever* for days and *not been drinking enough*, *leaving* their bodies *badly short of fluids*. Rest, rehydration 补水 and extra oxygen, along with 除…以外（还）;和…一起[一道] drugs for any secondary infections 继发性感染 that *have taken advantage* of the body’s stressed-out 因心理紧张而被压垮的 state, *give* the immune system a chance *to get the upper hand* 占上风；处于有利地位；有优势；有控制权.

- cannula :  /ˈkænjʊlə/ n. ( medical 医 ) a thin tube that is put into a vein or other part of the body, for example to give sb medicine （输药等的）套管，插管 +
=> 来自cane, 芦苇。-ula, 小词后缀。因形如小荒芜而得名。 +

-> a two-pronged fork 二齿叉 +
-> *a three-pronged attack* 三路进攻 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/p/prong.jpg[100,100]

- dehydration : /ˌdiːhaɪˈdreɪʃn/ n. 脱水 +
=> de-, 不，非，使相反。hydrate, 补水。即脱水。

- rehydration :  /,rihaɪ'dreʃən/ the process of putting water into someone's body when they are suffering from dehydration (= a lack of water) 当某人脱水时向其体内加水的过程

- *gain, get, have, etc. the upper hand* : to get an advantage over sb so that you are in control of a particular situation 占上风；处于有利地位；有优势；有控制权

- 在医院里，治疗通常会首先通过鼻腔插管(一根每个鼻孔都有一个尖刺的塑料管)提供额外的氧气，以及对抗脱水的治疗:患者通常会连续几天发烧，饮水不足，导致身体严重缺水。休息、补水和额外的氧气，以及治疗任何利用身体压力过大的继发性感染的药物，都可以让免疫系统来占得上风。



The immune response to a virus starts with infected cells producing a suite of signalling molecules called cytokines. Some of these tell other cells nearby to be on their guard against attack, thus stymying the virus’s ability to replicate itself. Others tell the immune system to come and put some stick about. Thus called to arms, the immune system launches both a prompt all-purpose response—inflammation—and a subsequent targeted counter-attack using antibodies and cells specifically programmed to attack both virus particles and the cells they have infected. Unfortunately SARS-CoV-2 seems able to interfere with the early steps of the immune response. It can apparently counteract the part that dampens replication in nearby cells. It may also enhance inflammation.

Whether the virus helps it along or not, severe inflammation of the lungs often leads to what is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is ARDS that sees people rushed to intensive-care units (ICUs) and put on ventilators.

Because it is hard to tolerate having a tube stuck down your throat and into your lungs, patients on ventilators are heavily sedated and unable to do anything for themselves. Nurses must reposition them every few hours to prevent bed sores. Their doctors keep watch for kidney failure, blood clots and heart problems—risks to critically ill patients in ICUs that anecdote has suggested may be more common in covid-19 patients than in others. Those anecdotes are now being backed up by a few studies. However, as Dominic Wichmann of the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf points out, this correlation does not necessarily mean SARS-CoV-2 is itself damaging the organs involved.



A quarter of covid-19 patients in British ICUs have had kidney problems severe enough to require dialysis. “It’s all part of the second phase of the illness when people, eight to ten days in, suddenly get worse,” says Claire Sharpe of King’s College London. A big part of the problem, she says, is just dehydration, always a risk in ICUs, all the more so when patients are feverish. On top of this, the stress caused to the body by having air pumped in and out amounts to “a double hit on the kidneys”.

Chains of command

Early in the pandemic critical-care doctors in various countries added to the problem by flushing fluids from the body in order to keep the patients’ damaged lungs from filling with liquid. They appreciated the risk of crashing the kidneys that this involved. Their thinking in doing it anyway, Dr Johnson says, was “I have to do everything I can to try to help their oxygen levels, because if I don’t win that then the whole game is lost.” Once doctors began to see high rates of kidney failure in covid-19 patients, though, they stopped “running them dry”. Dr Johnson, whose unit had the benefit of the experience from New York and other early hotspots, says kidney failure is now no more common in his covid-19 patients than in those with other viral pneumonias.

Blood clots are another worry for patients in ICUs—so much so that mild blood thinners are routinely used as a prophylactic. Again, the problem may be worse in covid patients. Autopsies of the first 12 people to die of covid-19 in Hamburg found that four had died from a blood clot in the lungs. Autopsies by other teams have turned up lots of small clots in the blood vessels traversing the lungs.



There are lots of reasons why covid-19 patients might be at higher risk of clots in the lung and elsewhere. Immobility is one: patients on ventilators are essentially paralysed, and those with covid-19 tend to stay on ventilators about twice as long as other ICU patients. Dehydration thickens the blood. The severe inflammation seen in covid-19 patients has a big role, too, says Jean Marie Connors of the Harvard Medical School, because clotting substances in the blood tend to increase in lockstep with the chemicals that bring on inflammation. There is also some evidence that the cells which line blood vessels are infected by the virus, she adds. These cells regulate substances that prevent clots—if the virus kills them off clotting can run wild.

Aftermath

At this stage of the disease, cardiologists are also on high alert. Some covid-19 patients whose lungs start to improve then see an extreme deterioration in their heart function. This is not likely to be simply the effect of being in an ICU. But no one knows whether the damage comes from the virus itself infecting the heart, or from the inflammation it triggers.

Harlan Krumholz of the Yale School of Medicine thinks both the virus and the immune response can be involved. In some people the antibody-making process can go awry, and their newly developed antibodies may confuse a healthy cell for an infected one, marking it for destruction by the immune system. That seems to be what happens in a rare sort of inflammation of the heart seen in some children with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

In most cases, though, it is the generalised immune response, inflammation, that goes into overdrive. Why some patients are prone to this problem remains unclear. But as data piles up from hospitals around the world clues about the biological pathways of the disease are starting to emerge.

Some of the clues come from the conditions which predispose people to the disease. “You’d think underlying lung problems or immune system problems will be the greatest risk,” says Dr Levitt. “But it seems the biggest risk factors have been hypertension, diabetes and obesity.” That has led many scientists to suspect that the profound inflammation seen in severe cases of covid-19 may be yet another problem linked to SARS-CoV-2’s fondness for ACE2. People with diabetes, hypertension and heart disease have more ACE2 on their cells as a response to the higher levels of inflammation that come with their condition; ACE2 has an anti-inflammatory effect. When SARS-CoV-2 sticks to ACE2 and reduces its ability to do its job, the underlying inflammation gets worse.



When inflammation gets completely out of control the body enters what is called a cytokine storm. Such storms drive the most severe outcomes for covid-19, including multi-organ failure. There is thus an obvious role for anti-inflammatory drugs. But knowing when to administer them is hard. Go too late, and the storm will be unstoppable; go too early, and you may dampen down an immune response that is turning the tide. A recent article in the Lancet suggests that it would help if covid-19 patients were routinely screened for hyper-inflammation to help identify those who might benefit from anti-inflammatory drugs. But not everyone is convinced today’s drugs have much to offer. “We tried [a range of anti-inflammatory treatment] and it actually didn’t work,” says Rajnish Jaiswal, who has been working on the front line of covid-19 treatment at New York’s Metropolitan Hospital.

All told, just 58% of those who have gone into British ICUs and are not still there have been discharged alive. The rest have died. This mortality rate is double that seen for other viral pneumonias in the past three years.

Many of those who survive a severe bout of covid-19 are likely to have long-term health problems. America’s Society of Critical Care Medicine has identified a collection of health problems including poor muscle strength and sub-par heart and lung function as “post-intensive care syndrome”; people who have had ARDS get it worse than most. Damaged lungs and kidneys can be expected to make good a lot of the harm done to them once a crisis is over, but for some it will take time, and long-term loss of function is possible.

A big worry is what happens to the brain. Sherry Chou of the University of Pittsburgh says that there is no evidence so far that SARS-COV-2 directly harms the brain or the central nervous system, but in parts of the brain, the spinal cord and the nerves the inflammation associated with the disease can lead to muscle weakness and other problems.

The mere fact of being in an ICU can also lead to cognitive impairment. The effect of more than a week in intensive care is comparable to that of a major head injury. The problems are linked to the delirium people often fall into when severely ill and heavily sedated in an unfamiliar environment. Delirium is a particular problem with covid-19, says Dale Needham of Johns Hopkins University. Patients spend a long time in the ICU during which they see no one they know—and the strangers caring for them in heavy-duty protective wear “look like aliens”.

Patients who have come through ARDS may also suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. It all adds up to a bleak prospect. In 2017 a study in the Baltimore-Washington area found that a third of previously employed patients who survived ARDS were not back at work five years on. Covid-19 will cast as long a shadow over some survivors’ lives as it will over those who mourn the dead.

THE FIRST SET of lungs felt like rubber, says Rainer Claus, so damaged that it was impossible to imagine how any amount of oxygen could get through them. The lungs in the rest of the ten covid-19 victims that he and his colleagues at the University Medical Centre Augsburg, in Germany, autopsied in early April were in similarly awful condition.

This has been, for the most part, the story around the world. People get infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes covid-19, by breathing in tiny liquid droplets containing virus particles. Those particles gain entry to the lungs, where they start reproducing themselves. If the immune system does not stop it—which it mostly does—the virus causes so much damage that the lungs can no longer do their job, ending up like those in Augsburg.

But there are other facets to the disease not so easily understood. It robs some of the infected of their sense of smell; in others the toes or fingers darken as if bruised. Hearts swell; blood clots; immune systems cripple organs they are meant to be saving. Doctors around the world are trying to find out how much these various symptoms are attributable to direct effects of the virus, to secondary effects of the damage it does to the lungs, or even, in some cases, to the treatments used against it. The more of the story they can disentangle, the better the standard of care is likely to get.

For the virus to attack a cell, the cell’s surface needs to be adorned with a protein which plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and inflammation called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This is found on plenty of cells in the upper respiratory tract and lungs, as well as the linings of blood vessels and the heart, kidneys and intestines. In some cases the virus may get into those intestinal cells directly, having been swallowed. In other cases it seems to get to the gut, and other susceptible organs, via the blood.

Mostly, though, the virus seems to get no further than the ACE2-rich cells of the nose and throat, and perhaps the lungs, before the body’s defences take care of it so well that its presence is never even noticed. Tests which look for genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 in swabs from the nose and throat frequently find it present in people who show no other sign of it at all: in one British survey 70% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic.

Most of those who do fall ill suffer flu-like symptoms, typically with a fever and a cough, sometimes with diarrhoea, that get better after a week or so. But some suffer for longer, failing to shake the infection before getting badly sick. Many of these people will, after a time, start to feel a shortness of breath as the lungs’ ability to oxygenate the blood weakens. About 10-15% of those who are diagnosed—which may mean less than 5% of those infected—eventually become ill enough to need a hospital.

Almost all of those hospitalised have symptoms of pneumonia—the general name for the response of the lungs to a variety of viral, bacterial and fungal infections. When they get deep into the lungs, the SARS-CoV-2 particles find a target-rich environment in the alveoli, tiny air sacs which hang like bunches of grapes off the lung’s branching network of bronchial tubes and are lined with cells festooned with ACE2. It is in these sacs that oxygen from the air breathed into the lungs passes into the blood stream, and carbon dioxide from the blood passes into the lung to be breathed out. The more the virus damages and kills the cells lining the alveoli, the more difficult this exchange of gases becomes. Hence the shortness of breath.

In some covid-19 cases, though, this shortness of breath—a textbook symptom of pneumonia—does not show up. Doctors have got used to seeing patients with blood-oxygen levels so low that they should be dizzy or unconscious, but who show no sign of respiratory distress.

Daniel Johnson of the University of Nebraska Medical Centre says his theory is that SARS-CoV-2 may be affecting the nervous system. That it can do so in some ways, at least, is hinted at by the fact that some patients report a loss of the sense of smell early on in their infection; there are other signs, too. Perhaps the virus has an effect on the part of the brain which tells the lungs to work harder when carbon dioxide builds up in the blood.

Angles of attack

Another possibility is that the lungs are not the only thing at fault. In some of these atypical patients the perilously low blood-oxygen level “seems to be out of proportion to the overall injury to the lung,” says Joseph Levitt of the Stanford University Medical Centre. The lungs of covid-19 patients feel different, too, he says. Typically, the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia become stiffer, which makes moving air in and out of them increasingly hard. The ventilators on to which such patients are put pump in oxygen under pressure, thus doing some of the lungs’ work for them. The lungs of covid-19 patients with blood-oxygen levels low enough to need a ventilator, though, are not so stiff, says Dr Levitt. They have not exhausted their ability to do their job. But the job is not getting done.

Dr Levitt wonders whether the problem may be in the blood vessels. ACE2’s role in looking after blood pressure depends on its ability to regulate signals that make blood vessels constrict or dilate. The way SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 probably makes it less able to take part in that signalling. Covid-19 may thus reduce the amount of oxygen which gets into tissues not just by damaging the lung, but also by narrowing and damaging blood vessels. If so, drugs to dilate the blood vessels might help, at least in some cases. Finding out what treatment works best along those lines, though, requires clinical trials, says Dr Levitt.

In hospitals the treatment will normally start with extra oxygen supplied through a nasal cannula (a plastic tube with a prong for each nostril) and therapy to combat dehydration: patients have typically had a fever for days and not been drinking enough, leaving their bodies badly short of fluids. Rest, rehydration and extra oxygen, along with drugs for any secondary infections that have taken advantage of the body’s stressed-out state, give the immune system a chance to get the upper hand.

The immune response to a virus starts with infected cells producing a suite of signalling molecules called cytokines. Some of these tell other cells nearby to be on their guard against attack, thus stymying the virus’s ability to replicate itself. Others tell the immune system to come and put some stick about. Thus called to arms, the immune system launches both a prompt all-purpose response—inflammation—and a subsequent targeted counter-attack using antibodies and cells specifically programmed to attack both virus particles and the cells they have infected. Unfortunately SARS-CoV-2 seems able to interfere with the early steps of the immune response. It can apparently counteract the part that dampens replication in nearby cells. It may also enhance inflammation.

Whether the virus helps it along or not, severe inflammation of the lungs often leads to what is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is ARDS that sees people rushed to intensive-care units (ICUs) and put on ventilators.

Because it is hard to tolerate having a tube stuck down your throat and into your lungs, patients on ventilators are heavily sedated and unable to do anything for themselves. Nurses must reposition them every few hours to prevent bed sores. Their doctors keep watch for kidney failure, blood clots and heart problems—risks to critically ill patients in ICUs that anecdote has suggested may be more common in covid-19 patients than in others. Those anecdotes are now being backed up by a few studies. However, as Dominic Wichmann of the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf points out, this correlation does not necessarily mean SARS-CoV-2 is itself damaging the organs involved.



A quarter of covid-19 patients in British ICUs have had kidney problems severe enough to require dialysis. “It’s all part of the second phase of the illness when people, eight to ten days in, suddenly get worse,” says Claire Sharpe of King’s College London. A big part of the problem, she says, is just dehydration, always a risk in ICUs, all the more so when patients are feverish. On top of this, the stress caused to the body by having air pumped in and out amounts to “a double hit on the kidneys”.

Chains of command

Early in the pandemic critical-care doctors in various countries added to the problem by flushing fluids from the body in order to keep the patients’ damaged lungs from filling with liquid. They appreciated the risk of crashing the kidneys that this involved. Their thinking in doing it anyway, Dr Johnson says, was “I have to do everything I can to try to help their oxygen levels, because if I don’t win that then the whole game is lost.” Once doctors began to see high rates of kidney failure in covid-19 patients, though, they stopped “running them dry”. Dr Johnson, whose unit had the benefit of the experience from New York and other early hotspots, says kidney failure is now no more common in his covid-19 patients than in those with other viral pneumonias.

Blood clots are another worry for patients in ICUs—so much so that mild blood thinners are routinely used as a prophylactic. Again, the problem may be worse in covid patients. Autopsies of the first 12 people to die of covid-19 in Hamburg found that four had died from a blood clot in the lungs. Autopsies by other teams have turned up lots of small clots in the blood vessels traversing the lungs.



There are lots of reasons why covid-19 patients might be at higher risk of clots in the lung and elsewhere. Immobility is one: patients on ventilators are essentially paralysed, and those with covid-19 tend to stay on ventilators about twice as long as other ICU patients. Dehydration thickens the blood. The severe inflammation seen in covid-19 patients has a big role, too, says Jean Marie Connors of the Harvard Medical School, because clotting substances in the blood tend to increase in lockstep with the chemicals that bring on inflammation. There is also some evidence that the cells which line blood vessels are infected by the virus, she adds. These cells regulate substances that prevent clots—if the virus kills them off clotting can run wild.

Aftermath

At this stage of the disease, cardiologists are also on high alert. Some covid-19 patients whose lungs start to improve then see an extreme deterioration in their heart function. This is not likely to be simply the effect of being in an ICU. But no one knows whether the damage comes from the virus itself infecting the heart, or from the inflammation it triggers.

Harlan Krumholz of the Yale School of Medicine thinks both the virus and the immune response can be involved. In some people the antibody-making process can go awry, and their newly developed antibodies may confuse a healthy cell for an infected one, marking it for destruction by the immune system. That seems to be what happens in a rare sort of inflammation of the heart seen in some children with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

In most cases, though, it is the generalised immune response, inflammation, that goes into overdrive. Why some patients are prone to this problem remains unclear. But as data piles up from hospitals around the world clues about the biological pathways of the disease are starting to emerge.

Some of the clues come from the conditions which predispose people to the disease. “You’d think underlying lung problems or immune system problems will be the greatest risk,” says Dr Levitt. “But it seems the biggest risk factors have been hypertension, diabetes and obesity.” That has led many scientists to suspect that the profound inflammation seen in severe cases of covid-19 may be yet another problem linked to SARS-CoV-2’s fondness for ACE2. People with diabetes, hypertension and heart disease have more ACE2 on their cells as a response to the higher levels of inflammation that come with their condition; ACE2 has an anti-inflammatory effect. When SARS-CoV-2 sticks to ACE2 and reduces its ability to do its job, the underlying inflammation gets worse.



When inflammation gets completely out of control the body enters what is called a cytokine storm. Such storms drive the most severe outcomes for covid-19, including multi-organ failure. There is thus an obvious role for anti-inflammatory drugs. But knowing when to administer them is hard. Go too late, and the storm will be unstoppable; go too early, and you may dampen down an immune response that is turning the tide. A recent article in the Lancet suggests that it would help if covid-19 patients were routinely screened for hyper-inflammation to help identify those who might benefit from anti-inflammatory drugs. But not everyone is convinced today’s drugs have much to offer. “We tried [a range of anti-inflammatory treatment] and it actually didn’t work,” says Rajnish Jaiswal, who has been working on the front line of covid-19 treatment at New York’s Metropolitan Hospital.

All told, just 58% of those who have gone into British ICUs and are not still there have been discharged alive. The rest have died. This mortality rate is double that seen for other viral pneumonias in the past three years.

Many of those who survive a severe bout of covid-19 are likely to have long-term health problems. America’s Society of Critical Care Medicine has identified a collection of health problems including poor muscle strength and sub-par heart and lung function as “post-intensive care syndrome”; people who have had ARDS get it worse than most. Damaged lungs and kidneys can be expected to make good a lot of the harm done to them once a crisis is over, but for some it will take time, and long-term loss of function is possible.

A big worry is what happens to the brain. Sherry Chou of the University of Pittsburgh says that there is no evidence so far that SARS-COV-2 directly harms the brain or the central nervous system, but in parts of the brain, the spinal cord and the nerves the inflammation associated with the disease can lead to muscle weakness and other problems.

The mere fact of being in an ICU can also lead to cognitive impairment. The effect of more than a week in intensive care is comparable to that of a major head injury. The problems are linked to the delirium people often fall into when severely ill and heavily sedated in an unfamiliar environment. Delirium is a particular problem with covid-19, says Dale Needham of Johns Hopkins University. Patients spend a long time in the ICU during which they see no one they know—and the strangers caring for them in heavy-duty protective wear “look like aliens”.

Patients who have come through ARDS may also suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. It all adds up to a bleak prospect. In 2017 a study in the Baltimore-Washington area found that a third of previously employed patients who survived ARDS were not back at work five years on. Covid-19 will cast as long a shadow over some survivors’ lives as it will over those who mourn the dead.





免疫系统对病毒的反应始于被感染的细胞产生一组称为细胞因子的信号分子。其中一些会告诉附近的其他细胞警惕攻击，从而影响病毒复制自身的能力。另一些则告诉免疫系统过来，把它粘起来。于是，免疫系统开始行动起来，同时启动一个快速的万能反应——炎症——以及随后的一个有针对性的反击，使用抗体和细胞来攻击病毒颗粒和它们感染的细胞。不幸的是，SARS-CoV-2似乎能够干扰免疫反应的早期步骤。它显然可以抵消抑制附近细胞复制的部分。它还可能加剧炎症。
无论病毒是否起到作用，严重的肺部炎症通常会导致所谓的急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)。在急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)中，人们被紧急送往重症监护病房(icu)，换上呼吸机。
因为很难忍受一根管子卡在你的喉咙里，进入你的肺里，使用呼吸机的病人被严重麻醉，不能自己做任何事情。护士必须每隔几个小时重新放置一次，以防止褥疮。他们的医生会密切关注肾衰竭、血块和心脏问题——在重症监护室中，危重患者面临的风险可能在covid-19患者中更为常见。这些轶事现在得到了一些研究的支持。然而，汉堡-埃彭多夫大学医学中心的Dominic Wichmann指出，这种相关性并不一定意味着SARS-CoV-2本身就损害了相关的器官。
在英国icu中，四分之一的covid-19患者有严重的肾脏问题，需要透析。伦敦大学国王学院的Claire Sharpe说:“这都是患者病情第二阶段的一部分，8到10天后，病情突然恶化。”她说，这个问题的很大一部分只是脱水，这在icu中是一个风险，当病人发烧时更是如此。除此之外，空气的进出对身体造成的压力相当于“对肾脏的双重打击”。

命令链
在大流行的早期，许多国家的急救医生为了防止病人受损的肺部充满液体而从体内冲洗液体，从而加剧了这一问题。他们意识到这可能会导致肾脏崩溃。约翰逊博士说，他们这样做的想法是“我必须尽我所能来提高他们的氧气水平，因为如果我没有赢，那么整个比赛就输了。”然而，当医生们发现covid-19患者肾衰竭的比例很高时，他们就停止了“烘干”。约翰逊博士说，肾衰竭在他的covid19患者中并不比其他病毒性肺炎患者更常见。
血栓是icu患者的另一个担忧——如此之多，以至于温和的血液稀释剂通常被用作预防药物。covid患者的问题可能更严重。在汉堡，对前12名死于covid-19的人进行了尸检，发现其中4人死于肺部的血凝块。其他研究小组的尸检发现，在穿过肺部的血管中有许多小血栓。
covid-19患者肺部和其他部位发生血栓的风险较高，原因有很多。不活动就是其中之一:使用呼吸机的患者基本上处于瘫痪状态，而covid-19患者使用呼吸机的时间往往是其他ICU患者的两倍。脱水使血液变稠。哈佛大学医学院(Harvard Medical School)的让•玛丽•康纳斯(Jean Marie Connors)说，covid-19患者出现的严重炎症也发挥了重要作用，因为血液中的凝血物质往往会与引发炎症的化学物质同步增加。她补充说，还有一些证据表明，排列在血管上的细胞受到了病毒的感染。这些细胞调节阻止凝血的物质——如果病毒杀死它们，凝血就会失控。
之后
在疾病的这一阶段，心脏病专家也处于高度警戒状态。一些covid-19患者的肺部开始好转，然后他们的心脏功能出现严重恶化。这不可能仅仅是住在ICU的影响。但没有人知道这种损害是由病毒感染心脏本身造成的，还是由它引发的炎症造成的。
耶鲁大学医学院的Harlan Krumholz认为病毒和免疫反应都可能参与其中。有些人的抗体生成过程可能出错，他们新开发的抗体可能会将健康细胞与受感染细胞混淆，标志着免疫系统将其摧毁。这似乎是发生在患有SARS-CoV-2抗体的儿童身上的一种罕见的心脏炎症。
然而，在大多数情况下，是全身性免疫反应——炎症——进入了超负荷状态。为什么有些病人容易出现这个问题还不清楚。但是随着来自世界各地医院的数据的堆积，关于这种疾病的生物学途径的线索开始出现。
一些线索来自于使人们易患这种疾病的条件。“你可能会认为潜在的肺部问题或免疫系统问题将是最大的风险，”莱维特博士说。“但最大的危险因素似乎是高血压、糖尿病和肥胖。这使得许多科学家怀疑，严重病例中出现的严重炎症可能是与SARS-CoV-2对ACE2的喜爱有关的另一个问题。患有糖尿病、高血压和心脏病的人，他们的细胞中有更多的ACE2，这是对伴随他们的疾病而来的更高水平的炎症的反应;ACE2具有抗炎作用。当SARS-CoV-2粘附在ACE2上并降低了它的工作能力时，潜在的炎症就会恶化。

当炎症完全失去控制时，身体就会进入细胞因子风暴。这种风暴导致covid-19最严重的后果，包括多器官衰竭。因此，抗炎药物的作用是显而易见的。但是知道什么时候给药是困难的。走得太晚，风暴将势不可挡;去得太早，你可能会抑制正在扭转局势的免疫反应。《柳叶刀》杂志(Lancet)最近的一篇文章指出，如果covid-19患者经常接受过度炎症检查，以帮助确定哪些人可能会从消炎药中受益，这将有所帮助。但并不是每个人都相信今天的药物有很大的作用。“我们尝试了[一系列抗炎治疗]，但实际上没有效果，”Rajnish Jaiswal说，他一直在纽约大都会医院工作，在covid19治疗的第一线。
总的来说，进入英国重症监护室的病人中，只有58%的人活着出院。其他人都死了。这一死亡率是过去三年其他病毒性肺炎死亡率的两倍。
许多在covid-19重症发作后存活下来的人可能会出现长期的健康问题。美国重症监护医学会(american Society of Critical Care Medicine)已将一系列健康问题确定为“重症监护综合症”，其中包括肌肉力量差、心肺功能低下;患有ARDS的人比大多数人都更糟糕。一旦危机结束，受损的肺和肾可以弥补对它们造成的很多伤害，但对一些人来说，这需要时间，长期的功能丧失是可能的。
一个很大的担忧是大脑会发生什么。雪莉匹兹堡大学的周说,迄今为止,没有证据表明,SARS-COV-2直接危害大脑或中枢神经系统,但在部分大脑、脊髓和神经炎症相关的疾病会导致肌肉无力和其他问题。
仅仅住在ICU这一事实也可能导致认知障碍。一个多星期的重症监护的效果与严重的头部损伤相当。这些问题与人们在不熟悉的环境中严重患病和严重服用镇静剂时经常出现的谵妄有关。约翰·霍普金斯大学的戴尔·李约瑟说，谵妄是covid-19的一个特别问题。病人在ICU里呆很长一段时间，在这段时间里他们看不到任何认识的人——而且那些穿着重型防护服照顾他们的陌生人“看起来就像外星人”。
患有急性呼吸窘迫综合征的患者还可能患有焦虑和创伤后应激障碍。所有这些都使前景暗淡。2017年，在巴尔的摩和华盛顿地区的一项研究发现，三分之一以前有工作的ARDS存活患者五年后没有重返工作岗位。Covid-19给一些幸存者和哀悼死者的人的生命投下的阴影一样长。
