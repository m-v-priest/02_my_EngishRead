- 这一大杂烩也反映了抗议活动具有的"扩散性"和"基本上是自发的"的性质。少数人，尤其是在弗洛伊德死后的早期，目睹了暴力，这些暴力先是由抗议者引起，然后是由越来越多的警察带来(尽管尚不清楚这些暴力活动, 是否由司法部长威廉·巴尔(William Barr)所指出的神秘的无政府左翼分子, 所造成的)。然而，绝大多数的多种族集会都是和平的。许多是由小镇上的朋友和邻居组织起来的。据一项统计，已有1280个地方发生了抗议活动，其中包括左翼激进分子的温床地点，如威斯康辛州的姊妹湾, 和怀俄明州的谢里登。

In big cities such as Washington, DC, black activist groups *have played a significant organising role*.

- 在特朗普任期内，中左翼激进主义的更广泛发展可能也起到了一定作用。这在很大程度上源于妇女游行，在总统就职后不久，吸引了数百万人走上街头抗议歧视女性。事实上，抗议活动催生的许多草根团体中, 一些团体最近参与了组织示威活动。在宾夕法尼亚州，一个名为“宾夕法尼亚站起来”的组织遍布全州，他们致力于对"投票权、移民改革、种族公正和其他中左翼议题"展开运动，帮助提高兰开斯特和费城的投票率, 并召集人群。

== No justice, no peace

America’s protests turn jubilant

Democrats are not organising them, but they do stand to gain

Jun 11th 2020 | WASHINGTON, DC


A WEEK AFTER the Trump administration ordered riot police to charge a peaceful crowd in Lafayette Square, it was transformed. The leafy park in front of the White House was enclosed by a steel fence, through which police could be seen loitering. The streets alongside it—including newly named “Black Lives Matter Plaza”, at the bottom of 16th Street, in direct view of the White House—had been colonised by protesters and were far more fun.

Late into the sultry evening, the chanting throng that had filled the plaza for much of the day—and most days since George Floyd’s murder—was winding down. Black musicians and street artists performed for a thinning crowd. A young woman had set up a stall offering free deodorants, tampons and fruit: “Take what you need—just know you are loved,” she carolled. Well-wishers ambled along the fence-line, perusing the banners, drawings and personal messages plastering it.

They offer a cultural history of America’s recent decades of racial injustice, including prayers for many of its victims. “I’m still crying for Emmett Till”, read one note decorated with hearts, beside a sketch of the 14-year-old child lynched in 1955. They also included more overtly political messages, such as “Who do you call when the police murders?” and, in reference to the White House’s well-guarded chief resident, “Bunker bitch”.

This potpourri also reflects the diffuse and largely spontaneous nature of the protests. A minority, especially in the early days after Mr Floyd’s death, have seen violence, first by protesters, then increasingly also by the police (though it is not clear that any of this was caused by the shadowy anarcho-leftists William Barr, the attorney general, has pointed to). The vast majority of the multiracial gatherings have been peaceful, however. Many have been organised by groups of friends and neighbours in small towns. By one count there have been protests in 1,280 places—including such hotbeds of left-wing militancy as Sister Bay, Wisconsin, and Sheridan, Wyoming.



In big cities such as Washington, DC, black activist groups have played a significant organising role. Many are members of a national coalition, the Movement for Black Lives, which was formed in 2014 and has 150 constituent parts. Its best-known, Black Lives Matter (BLM), which came to prominence over police killings during Barack Obama’s second term, has been especially influential, in part by rallying left-leaning whites, whose mass participation in these protests is their most novel feature. “The political weather has shifted,” says Makia Green of Black Lives Matter DC, “We now have widespread multiracial, multi-generation support.”

A broader growth of centre-left activism during Mr Trump’s tenure has probably also played a role. Much of it is rooted in the Women’s March that drew millions onto the streets shortly after the president’s inauguration to protest against misogyny. Indeed, some of the many grassroots groups spawned by that protest have been involved in organising demonstrations in recent days. One such in Pennsylvania, a state-wide organisation called Pennsylvania Stands Up, which campaigns on voting rights, immigration reform, racial justice and other centre-left issues, helped boost turnout and marshal crowds in Lancaster and Philadelphia.

Where is this headed? Perhaps not to the radical reforms many of the protesters demand. The current Congress has passed little except coronavirus stimuli. It is not about to start defunding the police. Yet academic research into the long-term political effects of the Women’s March and Tea Party movement of 2009 suggests such protests do not merely reflect public opinion. They also increase voter turnout. That sounds like more bad news for the president’s overwhelmingly white voting base.

“A lot of people who don’t normally vote say they’re going to vote now,” said Elena, a Hispanic property manager from Fairfax, Virginia, who had spent a long hot day at the plaza, “to be part of history” with her daughter and black boyfriend. “People can argue about whichever party is better for this or that,” she said. “But on this issue, it’s completely clear.”

- 四个月前，唐纳德•特朗普(Donald Trump)赢得第二任期的几率看起来从未如此之高。在弹劾审判中被轻松宣判无罪后，他的支持率达到了三年来的最高水平，接近40以上的区间，正是这一区间让乔治•w•布什(George W. Bush)和巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)得以连任。失业率达到了50年来的最低水平，这使得他将经济的强劲表现归功于自己。自称社会主义者的伯尼•桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)在前三场民主党初选中都赢得了普选。

- 4月8日，美国佛蒙特州独立参议员伯尼·桑德斯向其竞选团队成员宣布，退出美国总统大选. 在今年美国大选民主党初选中，桑德斯初期表现良好，纷纷拿下新罕布什尔州、内华达州等初选，但随后在“超级星期二”多州初选接连失利于前副总统拜登，随后，多名候选人在退选之后也转为支持拜登，让桑德斯感到大势已去。 +
伯尼·桑德斯宣布退出民主党总统初选，这意味着意味着前副总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）提前4个月获得民主党党内提名，将在11月大选中作为民主党候选人, 挑战现任共和党总统特朗普。

*on/to the verge of sth/of doing sth* : very near to the moment when sb does sth or sth happens 濒于；接近于；行将 +
=> 经由古法语verge来源于拉丁语virga(杆);“边缘”的意义来自于(英国)皇家总管大臣的土地裁判权,“权杖”是此权利的象征。作“接近,濒临”时,来源于拉丁语动词vergere(弯曲,倾斜)。 同源词：verger, virgule; converge, diverge +
-> He was *on the verge of tears*. 他差点儿哭了出来。 +
image:../../+ img_单词图片/v/verge.jpg[100,100]

image:../../+ img_单词图片/c/chasm.jpg[100,100]

- 但即使以特朗普的狂热标准来衡量，他的政治地位自那以后的暴跌也显得异常突然。首先，巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)的温和派副总统乔•拜登(Joe Biden)成功东山再起，从退选的边缘一跃成为假定候选人。然后，covid-19重创了美国，夺走了至少11万人的生命和3000万个工作岗位。就在病毒死亡人数开始减少的时候，乔治·弗洛伊德的死亡引发的抗议活动震惊了美国的各个城市。特朗普冷酷无情的回应扩大了他与拜登之间的共鸣鸿沟。

There is little question that 毫无疑问 if the election *were held* today, Mr Biden *would win* [in a near-landslide （山坡或悬崖的）崩塌，塌方，滑坡，地滑].

- trail : /treɪl/ v. to pull sth behind sb/sth, usually along the ground; to be pulled along in this way （被）拖，拉  +
/ *~ (by/in sth)* ( used especially in the progressive tenses 尤用于进行时 ) to be losing a game or other contest （在比赛或其他竞赛中）落后，失利，失败 +
-> The bride's dress *trailed behind her*. 新娘的结婚礼服拖在身后。 +

- 即使是在2月份总统的高点，他在全国民调中的平均支持率, 也落后于拜登5个百分点。现在赤字已经膨胀到8个。摇摆州的民调, 显示出类似的情况。拜登不仅在特朗普首次当选的中西部战场领先，而且在佛罗里达州和亚利桑那州也领先。即使是特朗普在2016年轻松获胜的州，比如乔治亚州、德克萨斯州、爱荷华州和俄亥俄州，看上去也颇具竞争力。毫无疑问，如果今天举行选举，拜登将以近乎压倒性的优势获胜。

- 事实上，我们有充分的理由期待他会这样做。首先，最新的就业报告表明, 经济可能已经触底。1984年，罗纳德•里根(Ronald Reagan)以“美国的早晨已经来到”的口号, 痛击了沃尔特•蒙代尔(Walter Mondale)，尽管以历史标准衡量，失业率仍处于高位。特朗普打算发表同样的观点。“黑人生命也是命”(Black Lives Matter)抗议活动, 也可能对民主党人产生适得其反的效果，如果他们像1968年所做的那样，将白人选民团结在这位“法律和秩序”(特朗普自诩)候选人的背后。

Like most forecasts, our model, built with the aid of two academics from Columbia, Andrew Gelman and Merlin Heidemanns, applies past patterns of voters’ behaviour to new circumstances. Its stated probability of victory answers the question: “How often have previous candidates in similar positions gone on to win?” If those historical relationships break down, our forecast will misfire. But one of the paradoxes presented by Mr Trump’s unprecedented presidency is that voters have mostly treated him as they would handle any other Republican.



Our analysis begins with “fundamentals”, or structural factors that shape the public’s choices. Predictably, when presidents have high approval ratings, their parties’ candidates tend to get more votes (see chart 1). Incumbents seeking re-election also fare better if the economy does well, though growing partisan polarisation has shrunk this effect. And voters seem to have an “eight-year itch”: only once since term limits were enacted in 1951 has the same party won three times in a row.

Because of the two-term penalty, these factors correctly predicted Mr Trump’s victory in 2016. Until recently, they were poised to favour him again: a typical modern incumbent with a good-not-great economy and bad-not-terrible approval ratings should win around 51% of the vote. However, the recession set off by covid-19 has turned the fundamentals against him.

Just how much this hurts Mr Trump is hard to estimate. First, no post-war president has been saddled with an economic crash this deep. Does moving from 10% unemployment to 15% hurt an incumbent as much as moving from 5% to 10%? Second, whereas recovery from previous economic calamities has been slow and grinding, the easing of lockdowns is likely to put millions of Americans back to work before the election. Come November, will voters punish Mr Trump for the big decline since February, or reward him for a smaller gain since April? Finally, voters may not treat a recession caused by a pandemic the same as one with economic roots. Despite mass unemployment, Mr Trump’s approval rating remains above its lows of 2017.



Our model acknowledges these unknowns by increasing the uncertainty in its predictions when economic conditions differ vastly from their historical norms, and dampening the impact of unusually large booms and busts (see chart 2). As a result, it treats the current downturn as merely 40% worse than 2009, rather than twice as bad. This is consistent with Mr Biden winning 53% of votes cast for either him or Mr Trump—a margin halfway between Mr Obama’s in 2008 and 2012, and one similar to his lead in the polls before the Floyd protests began.

Such fundamentals, however, are only a starting-point. Early in a campaign, they tend to predict final results far more reliably than polls do. Eventually, polls reveal whether voters are indeed reacting to the candidates as the fundamentals imply.

Polls are prone to biases, above and beyond their stated margins of error. Their results vary based on whether they are conducted by phone or online, which demographic categories they use to weight responses and how they seek to predict who will turn out to vote. Their results can also oscillate if one side’s partisans become unusually eager or disinclined to answer survey questions—a phenomenon known as “partisan non-response bias”.

Rather than analysing polls individually, our model considers them collectively. It assumes that particular survey methods, weighting schemes, adjustments for partisan non-response bias and the like influence reported results in unknown ways. Using a statistical method called Markov Chain Monte Carlo, it then estimates the impact of these factors, by finding the values for them that best explain the differences in results between pollsters surveying similar places at similar times. Finally, it blends the resulting polling average with a forecast based on fundamentals, placing greater weight on polls as time goes on.

With the election five months away, the model now relies mostly on fundamentals. These are sufficiently grim for Mr Trump that it gives him just a 5% chance of getting more votes than Mr Biden does. However, his overall odds of victory are about four times higher than that, thanks to a healthy chance that he once again wins the electoral college while losing the popular vote.



Reports of Mr Trump’s vice-like grip on the battleground states are a bit premature. States’ partisan leans relative to each other shift frequently. For example, in 2012 Barack Obama won Iowa by six percentage points while losing Texas by 16. Four years later, Mrs Clinton came closer to winning Texas than Iowa. Such volatility means advantages in the electoral college can be short-lived. Had the national popular vote been tied every year, the college would have delivered the presidency to Democrats in four of the five elections from 1996 to 2012 (see chart 3).

There is no guarantee that the electoral college will continue to favour Mr Trump. Mr Biden has fared well in polls of Arizona, whose Republican lean has shrunk since 2016. The state could provide him with another path to victory if he cannot wrest back Wisconsin—or, along with Florida, a sunbelt alternative to the entire rustbelt.

At the same time, there is also no evidence that Mr Trump’s electoral-college advantage has dwindled. In 2016 his vote share (excluding third parties) in Wisconsin, the state that delivered him the election, was 1.4 percentage points higher than his performance overall. Today, our model puts Mr Biden on track to win 53.5% of the nationwide two-party vote, and 52% in Pennsylvania, the most likely decisive state—a nearly identical gap of 1.5 points.

An electoral-college advantage of this size would not save Mr Trump if Mr Biden’s lead remains near its current level. But if Mr Trump were to cut Mr Biden’s edge in half, the current state of the electoral map would make him highly competitive. In such a scenario, Mr Biden would win the popular vote by as much as Mr Obama did in 2012—and be rewarded with a near-tie and possibly a disputed election.

The eerie resemblance between our estimate of Mr Biden’s chances and many calculations of Mrs Clinton’s odds four years ago may give Democrats a sense of déjà vu. Now as then, Mr Trump has a clear path to victory. An accelerating economic recovery, a continuing edge in battleground states, and an ill-timed gaffe, senior moment or scandal from Mr Biden could do the trick. Our model does not account for the impact of covid-19 on voter turnout (or, potentially, on the health of the two geriatric male nominees). As the underdog, Mr Trump should welcome this uncertainty. His chances of re-election are far greater than Mr Biden’s were in late February of winning the Democratic nomination.

But just as it was wrong to count Mr Trump out four years ago, it is wrong to regard him as invincible now. In 2016 polls favoured Mrs Clinton, whereas fundamentals favoured Mr Trump.

This time, history suggests that the electorate will punish an unpopular incumbent saddled with a depressed economy, and voters are currently telling pollsters they plan to do just that. What Mr Biden needs to do is run out the clock.

In early June, it gives Donald Trump a one-in-five shot at re-election

Jun 11th 2020 |


FOUR MONTHS ago, Donald Trump’s odds of winning a second term had never looked better. After an easy acquittal in his impeachment trial, his approval rating had reached its highest level in three years, and was approaching the upper-40s range that delivered re-election to George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Unemployment was at a 50-year low, setting him up to take credit for a strong economy. And Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist, had won the popular vote in each of the first three Democratic primary contests.

But even by Mr Trump’s frenetic standards, the tumble in his political stock since then has been remarkably abrupt. First, Joe Biden, Barack Obama’s moderate and well-liked vice-president, pulled off a comeback for the ages, surging from the verge of dropping out to presumptive nominee. Then covid-19 battered America, claiming at least 110,000 lives and 30m jobs. And just when deaths from the virus began to taper off, protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd convulsed cities across America. Mr Trump’s callous response has widened the empathy gap separating him from Mr Biden into a chasm.

Even at the president’s high-water mark in February, he trailed Mr Biden by five percentage points in national polling averages. That deficit has now swelled to eight. Polls of swing states tell a similar tale. Mr Biden is not only ahead in the midwestern battlegrounds that elected Mr Trump the first time, but also in Florida and Arizona. Even states that Mr Trump won easily in 2016, such as Georgia, Texas, Iowa and Ohio, look competitive. There is little question that if the election were held today, Mr Biden would win in a near-landslide.

The election, of course, will not be held today. In fact, more time remains between now and November 3rd than has passed since Mr Trump’s impeachment trial. And given the devotion of the president’s base, Mr Biden is probably approaching his electoral ceiling, whereas Mr Trump has plenty of room to win back soft supporters.



Burning down the House

Indeed, there are good reasons to expect he will. First, the latest jobs report suggests that the economy may have bottomed out. In 1984 Ronald Reagan trounced Walter Mondale by declaring “Morning in America”, though unemployment remained high by historical standards. Mr Trump plans to make the same argument. The Black Lives Matter protests could also backfire on Democrats if they rally white voters behind the “law and order” candidate, as they are thought to have done in 1968.



Given all this uncertainty, it is tempting to conclude that it is too early for predictions, and call the election a virtual toss-up. That is the view of bettors, who currently make Mr Biden a bare 55-45 favourite. Yet a hard look at the data and at history suggests that this is too generous to Mr Trump. The Economist’s first-ever statistical forecast of an American presidential race, which we launch this week and will update every day until the election, gives Mr Biden an 82% chance of victory.

Mr Trump’s unlikely triumph in 2016 left many quantitative election forecasters looking silly. Sam Wang, a professor at Princeton, vowed to eat a bug if Mr Trump, whom he said had just a 1% chance of victory in November 2016, came even close to winning. (He chose a cricket.)

However, statistical models that used a historically accurate amount of polling error, and factored in the tendency of such errors to benefit the same candidate in similar states, actually fared rather well. Given that Hillary Clinton led polls both nationwide and in a sufficient number of states to deliver her the electoral college, no rigorous forecast on the day of the election could have anointed Mr Trump the favourite. But numerous models put her chances at below 85%, and some were as low as 70%. (When applied retroactively to 2016, our own election-day forecast would have given Mrs Clinton a 71% shot—roughly the same probability it would have assigned to Mr Obama beating Mitt Romney on election day in 2012.) Just as solid number-crunching revealed the brittleness of Mrs Clinton’s position, we hope it will shed similar light on this year’s race.

Like most forecasts, our model, built with the aid of two academics from Columbia, Andrew Gelman and Merlin Heidemanns, applies past patterns of voters’ behaviour to new circumstances.

This time, history suggests that the electorate will punish an unpopular incumbent saddled with a depressed economy, and voters are currently telling pollsters they plan to do just that. What Mr Biden needs to do is run out the clock.



与大多数预测一样，我们的模型是在两位来自哥伦比亚大学的学者安德鲁•格尔曼(Andrew Gelman)和梅林•海德曼斯(Merlin Heidemanns)的帮助下建立的，它将选民过去的行为模式应用于新的情况。它所陈述的获胜概率回答了这样一个问题:“先前处于类似地位的候选人获胜的几率有多大?”“如果这些历史关系破裂，我们的预测就会失败。但特朗普史无前例的总统任期所带来的矛盾之一是，选民对待他的方式，基本上与对待其他任何共和党人一样。
我们的分析从“基本面”开始，也就是影响公众选择的结构性因素。可以预见的是，当总统拥有较高的支持率时，其政党的候选人往往会获得更多的选票(见表1)。如果经济状况良好，寻求连任的现任者也会表现得更好，尽管日益增长的党派分化缩小了这种影响。选民们似乎有一种“八年之痒”:自1951年实行任期限制以来，同一政党只有一次连续三次获胜。
由于特朗普被判两届任期，这些因素正确地预测了特朗普在2016年的胜利。直到最近，他们还准备再次支持他:一个典型的现代在任者，经济好而不坏，支持率不高，应该能赢得51%左右的选票。然而，covid-19引发的经济衰退使基本面对他不利。
这对特朗普有多大伤害是难以估计的。首先，战后没有哪位总统遭受过如此严重的经济危机。失业率从10%上升到15%和从5%上升到10%对在职者的伤害一样大吗?其次，尽管从以往的经济灾难中复苏是缓慢而艰难的，但放松封锁可能会让数百万美国人在大选前重返工作岗位。到了11月，选民是会因为特朗普自2月以来的大幅下跌而惩罚他，还是会因为他自4月以来的小幅上涨而奖励他?最后，选民们可能不会把大流行造成的衰退与经济根源造成的衰退相提并论。尽管存在大规模失业，但特朗普的支持率仍高于2017年的低点。

我们的模型承认这些未知数通过增加其预测的不确定性,当经济条件大大从历史标准不同,和抑制异常大的繁荣和萧条的影响(见表2)。因此,它将当前的低迷视为仅仅比2009年的40%,而不是坏的两倍。这与拜登赢得53%的选票支持他或特朗普是一致的——这是奥巴马在2008年和2012年的一半优势，与他在弗洛伊德抗议开始之前的民调领先相似。
然而，这些基础只是一个起点。在竞选初期，他们往往会比民意调查更可靠地预测最终结果。最终，民意调查将揭示选民是否真的像基本面所暗示的那样对候选人做出反应。
民意调查往往会有偏差，超出其声明的误差范围。他们的结果会因以下因素而有所不同:是通过电话还是网上进行的，他们使用何种人口统计分类来衡量回复的权重，以及他们如何试图预测谁会去投票。如果其中一方的党派变得异常急切或不愿意回答调查问题，他们的结果也会摇摆不定——这种现象被称为“党派不回应偏见”。
我们的模型不是单独分析民意调查，而是综合考虑。它假设特定的调查方法、加权方案、党派无反应偏差的调整以及类似的影响以未知的方式报告结果。然后使用马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛统计方法，通过找到这些因素的值来估计这些因素的影响，这些值可以最好地解释调查人员在类似时间、类似地点调查结果的差异。最后，它将得出的民意调查平均值与基于基本面的预测相结合，随着时间的推移，对民意调查给予更大的重视。
距离大选还有五个月，这种模式现在主要依赖于基本面因素。这些对特朗普来说已经够严峻的了，他只有5%的机会比拜登获得更多的选票。然而，他获胜的总几率大约是这个数字的四倍，这是因为他很有可能在失去普选的情况下再次赢得选举团。
有关特朗普像副总统一样掌控着摇摆州的报道有点为时尚早。州之间的党派倾向经常发生变化。例如，2012年，巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)以6个百分点的优势赢得了爱荷华州，却以16个百分点的劣势输掉了德克萨斯州。四年后，希拉里赢得德克萨斯州的几率比赢得爱荷华州的几率更小。这种不确定性意味着选举人团的优势可能是短暂的。如果每年的全国普选票数都是相同的，那么从1996年到2012年的5次选举中，该学院就有4次将总统职位交给了民主党人(见图3)。
不能保证选举团会继续支持特朗普。拜登在亚利桑那州的民调中表现良好，该州的共和党倾向自2016年以来有所减弱。如果他不能夺回威斯康辛州，或者和佛罗里达州一样，成为整个“锈带”的另一个选择，这个州可以为他提供另一条胜利之路。
与此同时，也没有证据表明特朗普的选举人团优势已经减弱。2016年，他在威斯康辛州的投票份额(不包括第三党派)比他的总体表现高出1.4个百分点。威斯康辛州是他赢得大选的州。今天，我们的模式使拜登先生有望在全国范围内赢得53.5%的两党选票，在最有可能起决定性作用的宾夕法尼亚州赢得52%的选票——相差几乎相同的1.5个百分点。
如果拜登的领先优势保持在目前的水平附近，这种规模的选举人团优势也救不了特朗普。但如果特朗普将拜登的优势减半，目前的选举形势将使他极具竞争力。在这样的情况下，拜登先生将会和奥巴马先生在2012年一样赢得普选，并且回报是一场势均力敌，甚至可能是一场有争议的选举。

我们对拜登获胜几率的估计，与四年前对希拉里获胜几率的许多估算惊人地相似，这可能让民主党人有一种似曾相识的感觉。现在和当时一样，特朗普有一条清晰的胜利之路。加速的经济复苏，摇摆州的持续优势，以及拜登先生不合时宜的失态，高级职位的出现或者丑闻都可能会起到作用。我们的模型没有考虑covid-19对选民投票率的影响(或对两名被提名的老年男性的健康的潜在影响)。作为弱者，特朗普应该欢迎这种不确定性。他再次当选的几率远高于拜登在2月底赢得民主党提名的几率。
但是，就像四年前把特朗普排除出去是错误的一样，现在认为他不可战胜也是错误的。2016年的民调支持希拉里，而基本面则支持特朗普。
这一次，历史表明，选民们将惩罚经济低迷而不受欢迎的现任总统，而选民们目前正告诉民调机构，他们正计划这么做。拜登需要做的是把时间用完。
