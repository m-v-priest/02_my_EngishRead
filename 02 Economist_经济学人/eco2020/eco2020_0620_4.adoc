- 危机可以带来(现状真相的)清晰化。在2008-09年的金融危机中，由大型经济体组成的20国集团, 形成了自己的集团，反映出经济实力是如何扩散到富裕世界七国集团(G7)之外的。covid-19大流行暴露了全球领导力的缺失。covid-19大流行暴露了全球领导力的缺失。这一次，20国集团除了口头承诺“不惜一切代价”, 和支持暂停贫穷国家的债务偿还之外，几乎没有做什么。领导了全球抗击艾滋病毒/艾滋病和埃博拉的美国，已经被自己的国内争论所吸引。联合国安理会也证实了自己的功能失调。



The council’s 政务委员会，地方议会 five permanent members (P5) *are split*(v.)分裂，使分裂（成不同的派别）;分担；分摊；分享 *between* the Western three *and* Russia and China; some *suspect* the authoritarian(a.)威权主义的；专制的 duo(n.)一对表演者；搭档;二重奏；二重唱；二人组 *of* having(v.) a formal pact 条约；协议；公约.

France and Russia *have both been keen for* the leaders of the P5 *to get together* in the UN’s anniversary year, but *have found* this hard to arrange.

- split : v. to divide, or to make a group of people divide, into smaller groups that have very different opinions 分裂，使分裂（成不同的派别） /  *~ sth (between sb/sth) | ~ sth (with sb)* to divide sth into two or more parts and share it between different people, activities, etc. 分担；分摊；分享 +

-> *We mustered* what support we could *for* the plan. 我们极尽所能, 为这项计划寻求支持。 +
-> She left(v.) the room [*with all the dignity she could muster*(v.)] . 她尽量庄重体面地走了出去。

- 安理会的五个常任理事国(P5), 分为西方的三个国家以及俄罗斯和中国; 一些人怀疑这两个威权政体的二人组,有一个正式的协议。俄罗斯经常行使否决权，有时与中国一起行使否决权。理事会并没有立即就covid-19采取行动，而是在4月份才召集了第一次关于该危机的讨论。法国和俄罗斯都希望P5国家的领导人, 能在联合国周年纪念日聚在一起，但却发现这很难安排。。

The pandemic *hit* when competition between America and China, the world’s dominant(a.)处于支配地位的 and emerging superpowers, *was already intense*, *stretching from* trade and technology *to* finance and regional dominance(n.)优势; 统治地位 in Asia. In America *there is* a bipartisan 两党的；涉及两党的 perception of China *as* a rival that *steals* intellectual property, *takes advantage of* America’s openness and *is intent(a.)决心做（尤指伤害他人的事） on* chipping(v.) away at 不停地削（或凿） America’s lead. For its part 就其本身而言, China *is increasingly brazen*(a.)厚颜无耻的;黄铜制的；黄铜色的 in *pushing back against* 反击 America (or any country *that resists(v.)抵制 it*).

- 当疫情大流行来袭时，美国和中国, 一个是世界霸主, 一个是新兴的超级大国, 它们之间的竞争已经很激烈，领域包括从贸易和技术, 到金融, 及对亚洲地区的主导地位。在美国，两党都认为中国是一个窃取知识产权、利用美国的开放, 并意图削弱美国领先地位的对手。就其自身而言，中国越来越肆无忌惮地反击美国(或任何抵制它的国家)。

Any retreat by America from global leadership *is* an opportunity for China

The covid-19 crisis *is proving a telling(a.)生动的；显露真实面目的，说明问题的（通常并非有意） case study* 个案研究；专题研究；案例研究 of this rivalry 竞争；竞赛；较量, as America *blames* China *for* causing the pandemic / and China *positions 安装；安置；使处于 itself as* the country (most capable of *dealing with it*).

- *case study* : n. a detailed account of the development of a person, a group of people or a situation over a period of time 个案研究；专题研究；案例研究

- 美国退出全球领导地位的任何行动，对中国都是一个机会 +
covid-19危机就是一个很好的例子，美国指责中国造成了疫情，而中国将自己定位为最有能力应对疫情的国家。美国从全球领导地位上的任何退却，都是中国取得进展的机会。在美国暂停向世界卫生组织提供资金的同时，中国承诺为抗击疫情提供20亿美元。



President Xi Jinping *portrays  将…描写成；给人以某种印象；表现 China as* a champion of multilateralism 多边主义，多边政策（为达成核裁军多边协议） and *talks of* *taking “an active part in* leading(v.) the reform of the global governance system”. China *has been building channels of influence [outside* the institutions that America *designed*]. It *set up* the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, *encroaching 侵蚀，蚕食（土地）;侵占（某人的时间）；侵犯（某人的权利）；扰乱（某人的生活等） on* the World Bank’s territory. It *has championed* 为…而斗争；捍卫；声援 the BRICS 金砖四国 (*bringing it together* with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa) and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, an eight-member group that *includes* Russia and Central Asian countries *as well as* India and Pakistan. And then there is Mr Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an all-embracing(a.)无所不包的；概括一切的 infrastructure and development campaign.

- 习表示，中国是多边主义的倡导者，将“积极参与引领全球治理体系改革”。中国一直在美国设计的制度之外建立影响渠道。中国成立了亚洲基础设施投资银行(Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank)，蚕食了世界银行(World Bank)的地盘。中国支持金砖国家(包括巴西、俄罗斯、印度和南非)和上海合作组织(一个包括俄罗斯、中亚国家以及印度和巴基斯坦的8国集团)。然后是习近平的一带一路倡议(BRI), 该活动是对各种基础设施建设和和开发活动的总括。

China *has also been methodically 有方法地；有系统地;有条不紊的,有条理地 increasing* its influence in existing institutions, not least the UN. It *has raised its financial support* even as America *became stingier*  小气的；吝啬的(比较级), *becoming* the second-biggest contributor *to* both the general 正常的；一般的；常规的 and the peacekeeping budgets. It *has grown more assertive*  坚定自信的；坚决主张的. “Ten years ago, China *was pretty discreet* (a.)（言行）谨慎的，慎重的，考虑周到的, *pretending to be* just an emerging country,” says one European diplomat at the UN. “Now *I can tell you* they are totally uninhibited(a.)纵情的；无拘无束的；随心所欲的, they *want to run the system*.”

- 中国还在有条不紊地增强其在现有机构中的影响力，尤其是在联合国。在美国变得更加吝啬的情况下，它却增加了财政支持，成为军费和维和预算的第二大贡献者。它变得更加自信。“十年前，中国相当谨慎，假装只是一个新兴国家，”联合国的一位欧洲外交官表示。“现在我可以告诉你，它们完全不受约束，它们想要管理这个系统。”

China has *been patiently placing*  （小心或有意）放置，安放;使（人）处于某位置；安置；安顿 high-fliers(n.)有雄心壮志者; 可展翅高飞者(复数) *to work their way up* 逐步升职；按部就班晋升 through the ranks. Chinese nationals （某国的）公民 now *head*(v.) four of the UN’s 15 specialised agencies, including *the Food and Agriculture Organisation* in Rome and *the International Telecommunication Union* in Geneva. Americans *lead*(v.) only one. Chinese officials *toil （长时间）苦干，辛勤劳作;艰难缓慢地移动；跋涉  away* （用于动词后）持续地，劲头十足地 at *inserting into documents* ① favourable 有利的；有助于…的 references to the BRI and ② language (*friendly to* their interpretation of human rights), *stressing* national sovereignty 主权；最高统治权；最高权威 and development (“*mutual respect* and *win-win co-operation*”). [Behind the scenes] China *twists  扭转，转动（身体部位） arms* 软硬兼施;劝说；强迫；生拉硬拽；施加压力 to avoid(v.) criticism of its repression in Xinjiang or Tibet.

-> They *were soon chatting away* like old friends. 他们很快就像老朋友一样聊起天来。

- *twist sb's arm*  : ( informal ) to persuade or force sb to do sth 劝说；强迫；生拉硬拽；施加压力

- 中国一直在耐心地安置雄心勃勃的人，让他们在联合国机构中一路晋升。中国人现在领导着联合国15个专门机构中的4个，其中包括位于罗马的联合国粮农组织(Food and Agriculture Organisation), 和位于日内瓦的国际电信联盟(International Telecommunication Union)。美国人只领导这其中一个。中国官员努力在文件中加入对“一带一路”的支持，插入有利于他们解释人权的有利提法和语言，强调国家主权和发展(“相互尊重、合作共赢”)。在幕后，中国为了避免外界对其在新疆或西藏的镇压行为的批评，采取了软硬兼施的手段。


Small victories 胜利 for China *have mounted up*, often *in* obscure  无名的；鲜为人知的 documents and little-noticed forums, but occasionally *raising eyebrows* 扬起眉毛（表示不赞同或惊讶）. In the 15-member Security Council, for example, the West and its friends *can normally count on* 依赖，依靠，指望（某人做某事）；确信（某事会发生） the requisite 必需的；必备的；必不可少的 nine votes *to get their way* 执意地按自己的方式行事；不达到目的不罢休 on procedural （商业、法律或政治上的）程序 matters 程序事项. But in March 2018 `主` an American-backed proposal for the UN high commissioner (一个国际委员会的)高级专员  for human rights *to brief(v.)给（某人）指示；向（某人）介绍情况;向（辩护律师）提供案情摘要 a formal session* （议会等的）会议，会期 on abuses 虐待 in Syria `谓` *was defeated* when, after Chinese pressure, Ivory Coast 象牙海岸（非洲）;科特迪瓦 *switched sides* [at the last minute].

- *count on sb/sth* : to trust sb to do sth or to be sure that sth will happen 依赖，依靠，指望（某人做某事）；确信（某事会发生） bank on sth +
-> ‘I'm sure he'll help. ’ ‘ *Don't count on it* . ’
“我肯定他会帮忙的。”“那可靠不住。”

- *get/have your own way* : to get or do what you want, especially when sb has tried to stop you 一意孤行；为所欲为 +
-> She always *gets her own way* in the end.
到最后总是她说了算。

- procedural : /prəˈsiːdʒərəl/ ADJ Procedural means involving a formal procedure. 程序的 +
->  A Spanish judge *rejected the suit [on procedural grounds*].
一名西班牙法官以程序理由驳回了该起诉。

- 中国取得的小胜利, 不断增加，通常是在一些不为人知的文件, 和不为人注意的论坛上，但偶尔也会引起人们的惊讶。例如，在由15个成员国组成的安理会中，西方国家及其盟友, 通常可以依靠必要的九票, 来解决程序性问题。但在2018年3月，一项由美国支持的提议, 被否决，该提议要求联合国人权事务高级专员, 就叙利亚的虐权问题, 举行一次正式会议，但因为在中国的压力下，科特迪瓦在最后一刻改变了立场。

The aim 目的；目标 *may not be* `表` *to replace*(v.) America *as* a superpower that *bears burdens* all around the world. More likely, China *simply wants* an unencumbered 无负担的；没有阻碍的；不受妨碍的 path *for* further development. “People’s Republic of the United Nations”, a report last year from the Centre for a New American Security (CNAS), a think-tank, *concluded that* China *was “making* the world *safe for autocracy*” 独裁政体；专制制度. For a long time *America paid little attention*, but *it is now pushing back*. In January the State Department （美国）国务院 *appointed* a senior diplomat, Mark Lambert, *to counter(v.)抵制；抵消; 反驳；驳斥 the “malign 有害的；引起伤害的 influence”* of China and others at the UN. In March these efforts *succeeded* in *thwarting* 阻止；阻挠；对…构成阻力 China’s bid for the top job at a fifth UN agency, the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva.

- thwart : /θwɔːt/ [ VN ] *~ sth /~ sb (in sth)* to prevent sb from doing what they want to do 阻止；阻挠；对…构成阻力 +
=> 原义为副词，来自古诺斯语 thvert,穿过，横过. 词源同 turn,through,trans-. 后引申动词词义相反，阻止，阻挠等。

- 其目的可能不是要取代美国，成为一个在世界各地背负重担的超级大国。更有可能的是，中国只是想要一条不受阻碍的发展道路。智库“新美国安全中心”(CNAS)去年发布的一份报告《联合国人民共和国》断定，中国正在“为独裁统治创造世界安全”。在很长一段时间里，美国几乎没有注意到这一点，但现在它正在反击。今年1月，美国国务院任命高级外交官马克•兰伯特(Mark Lambert), 来对抗中国和其他国家在联合国的“恶意影响”。。今年3月，这些努力成功地挫败了中国对其联合国第五个机构——位于日内瓦的世界知识产权组织(World Intellectual Property Organisation)——最高职位的申请。

At least such moves(n.) *reflect* a recognition  认出；认识；识别;承认；认可 by the American administration *that* multilateral institutions *matter*(v.). Just as Mr Trump no longer *calls* NATO “obsolete”(a.)淘汰的；废弃的；过时的, *as he did* [before *coming to power* （开始）掌权，上台], he *may yet find* more use(n.) [in the UN]. He *would not be* the first American president *to come to believe that*, annoying *as* 尽管；虽然；即使 international forums are, they are better *than* a constant 连续发生的；不断的；重复的;不变的；固定的；恒定的 free-for-all(n.)不加管制；自由放任;混战；众人激烈争辩；大吵大闹, and they *can take* some of the load 负载；负荷 *off* a superpower. But his transactional 交易的，业务的； （社会交往中）相互作用的; approach *has unnerved* allies, and *badly dented  损害，伤害，挫伤（信心、名誉等）;使凹陷；使产生凹痕 their trust*(n.) in American leadership.

-  as : used to say that in spite of sth being true, what follows is also true 尽管；虽然；即使
SYN though +
-> Happy *as* they were, there was something missing. 尽管他们很快乐，但总缺少点什么。 +
-> Try *as* he might (= however hard he tried) , he couldn't open the door. 他想尽了办法也没能打开门。

- constant : a. [常用于名词前] happening all the time or repeatedly 连续发生的；不断的；重复的 / that does not change 不变的；固定的；恒定的 +
-> Babies need *constant attention*. 婴儿一刻也离不开人。
-> travelling *at a constant speed of 50 m.p.h*.
以每小时50英里的恒定速度行驶


- 至少这些举动, 反映了美国政府对多边机构的重视。正如特朗普不再像上台前那样称北约为“过时的”一样，他或许还会在联合国找到更多有用之处。他不会是第一个相信这样一种观点的美国总统，尽管国际论坛令人讨厌，但它们总比一场持续的混战要好，而且它们可以减轻一个超级大国的负担。但他的交易方式让盟友不安，严重削弱了他们对美国领导地位的信任。

In search(n.) of a middle way

As a result, “middle powers” 中等强国,中等国家 *have been searching for* other ways *to defend* the liberal order. A white paper (*presented* last year by Norway’s foreign ministry *to* its parliament) *identified*  确认；认出；鉴定 *preventing* the erosion of international law and multilateral systems *as* a “primary foreign-policy interest”. In New York, France and Germany *launched* an Alliance （国家、政党等的）结盟，联盟，同盟 for Multilateralism 多边主义, with the aim of *forging(v.)艰苦干成；努力加强;锻造；制作 varied coalitions* （尤指多个政治团体的）联合体，联盟 *to take the initiative 掌握有利条件的能力（或机会）；主动权 on* issues *ranging from* fake news and responsible use of cyberspace *to* gender equality and strengthening international institutions.

- 因此，“中等国家”一直在寻找其他方式来捍卫自由秩序。挪威外交部去年向其议会提交的一份白皮书, 将防止国际法和多边体系的侵蚀, 确定为“首要的外交政策利益”。在纽约，法国和德国启动了多边主义联盟，目的是结成各种联盟，在假新闻、负责任地使用网络空间、性别平等, 和加强国际机构等问题上, 采取主动。

Coalitions of like-minded 想法相同的；志趣相投的 countries *have proliferated* 激增. After Mr Trump *abandoned* the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal, Australia, Japan and nine other countries *pressed ahead 坚决继续进行；匆忙前进；加紧 on their own*. The EU and Japan *completed a trade agreement* covering a third of the world’s GDP. On defence, President Emmanuel Macron of France *has gathered* 13 other countries *into* a European Intervention Initiative and *is ever keener on* “strategic autonomy”(n.)自治；自治权;自主；自主权 for Europe. `主` Asian countries *worried about* growing Chinese assertiveness 魄力，自信, and *unsure of* America’s commitment, `谓` *are deepening(v.) ties*.

- *press ahead/on (with sth)* : to continue doing sth in a determined way; to hurry forward 坚决继续进行；匆忙前进；加紧 +
-> The company *is pressing ahead* with its plans for a new warehouse. 这家公司正加紧推动设置新仓库的计划。 +
-> ‘Shall we stay here for the night?’ ‘No, *let's press on*.’ “我们今晚在这里住下好吗？”“不，咱们继续走。”

- 志同道合的国家联盟激增。在特朗普放弃了自由贸易协定《跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》(Trans-Pacific Partnership，简称tpp)之后，澳大利亚、日本和其他9个国家自行推进。欧盟和日本达成了一项涵盖全球三分之一GDP的贸易协定。在国防方面，法国总统伊曼纽尔·马克龙召集了其他13个国家加入欧洲干预倡议，并越来越热衷于让欧洲实现“战略自治”。亚洲国家对中国日益增长的自信很担忧，又不确定美国的承诺，这些都加深了中等国家之间的联系。

In such “minilateralist” or “plurilateralist” 多样的；多元的多边主义 ventures, national governments *are not* the only actors. Regional states, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and business leaders *are* on stage too. In the response to covid-19, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a philanthropic  慈善的; 博爱的 giant, *is taking a more prominent part* than many governments. Several American states *have been busy* since Mr Trump *withdrew from* the Paris agreement. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, *hosted* a Global Climate Action Summit in 2018. *Totting up* 把…加起来；计算…的总和 actions at subnational 低于国家的/地方的 levels *that collectively would amount to* the world’s second-biggest economy, one estimate *suggests* they *could reduce* America’s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 *by* as much as 37% *from* 2005 levels.

-  plural :  /ˈplʊrəl/ a. relating to more than one 多样的；多元的 +
-> a plural society (= one with more than one racial , religious, etc. group) 多元社会

- philanthropic :  /ˌfɪlənˈθrɑːpɪk/ ADJ A philanthropic person or organization freely gives money or other help to people who need it. 慈善的; 博爱的 +
=> From French philanthropique

- *tot sth up* : ( informal ) ( especially BrE ) to add together several numbers or amounts in order to calculate the total 把…加起来；计算…的总和 / tot  : n. 幼儿 +
=> 词源不详，可能缩写自 totter,蹒跚，摇摆。

- 在这种“微型多边主义”或“多元多边主义”的冒险中，各国政府并不是唯一的行动者。地区国家、非政府组织和商业领袖也在台上发挥作用。在应对covid-19的行动中，慈善巨头比尔和梅林达•盖茨基金会(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)所起的作用, 比许多政府更为突出。自特朗普退出《巴黎协定》以来，美国几个州一直在忙碌。加州州长杰里·布朗(Jerry Brown)在2018年主持了一次全球气候行动峰会。将地方层面的行动加起来，就相当于世界第二大经济体，一项估计表明，到2030年，这些行动将使美国的温室气体排放量, 比2005年的水平减少37%。


Whether these scattered mid-level moves *can amount to* more than the sum of their parts is unclear. Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank, suggests that like-minded countries should form a “coalition of the responsible”. Since some middle powers, such as Taiwan and South Korea, have distinguished themselves by their response to the pandemic, he also proposes “coalitions of the competent”. Further bungling by the big powers over covid-19 could make a concert of middle powers more urgent. But do not bank on this being a middle-power moment, says Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, another think-tank. Without a dominant power to set an agenda, force momentum and provide a chunk of funding, it is very hard for co-operation among lesser countries “to reach escape velocity”. At best it may slow rather than stop the erosion of the liberal order.

If middle powers are active, so are smaller ones. By clubbing together, even minnows can have influence. Under its charter the UN is “based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members”, so each of the 193 countries in the General Assembly has one vote. India (1.4bn people) counts the same as Tuvalu (12,000).

The Group of 77, formed in 1964 and now embracing 134 members, pushes the interests of developing countries. It is less homogenous than it was but it can have influence (eg, over the choice of secretary-general) and get attention (picking Palestine to serve as its chair last year). The Alliance of Small Island States helped put the climate-change issue on the map. Samantha Power, America’s UN ambassador during Barack Obama’s second term, made a point of visiting her counterparts from every member country at their New York missions: she managed all except North Korea’s.

With just six embassies around the world, the diplomatic footprint of the Caribbean state of St Vincent and the Grenadines (population: 111,000) is tiny, but a good example of small-country influence. One of its embassies is in Taipei: it is among a handful of states that officially recognise Taiwan. Its mission in New York has been expanding, since St Vincent currently has one of the ten non-permanent seats on the 15-member Security Council. “The bedrock principle that all small states advocate for is adherence to international law,” says Inga Rhonda King, St Vincent’s ambassador. They’re “very hard core” over sovereign equality, non-interference and non-intervention, she adds. The Security Council seat gives her a chance to press core concerns (especially climate security and relations with Africa) and, hers being a small country, to do so nimbly. Ms King would like to see similar nimbleness in the council’s response to covid-19, drawing attention to Africa as the pandemic’s likely next frontier.

Who runs the world?

As America gets tired, China gets busy

Jun 18th 2020 |


CRISES CAN bring clarity. In the financial crisis of 2008-09, the G20 club of big economies came into its own, reflecting how economic power had spread beyond the rich world’s G7. One thing the covid-19 pandemic has laid bare is an absence of global leadership. This time the G20 has done little beyond a rhetorical pledge to “do whatever it takes” and supporting debt-repayment suspension for poor countries. America, which led global campaigns to defeat HIV/AIDS and Ebola, has been absorbed in its internal arguments. And the UN Security Council has confirmed its dysfunctionality.

The council’s five permanent members (P5) are split between the Western three and Russia and China; some suspect the authoritarian duo of having a formal pact. Russia wields its veto often, sometimes alongside China. Instead of leaping into action over covid-19, the council mustered its first discussion of the crisis only in April. France and Russia have both been keen for the leaders of the P5 to get together in the UN’s anniversary year, but have found this hard to arrange.

The pandemic hit when competition between America and China, the world’s dominant and emerging superpowers, was already intense, stretching from trade and technology to finance and regional dominance in Asia. In America there is a bipartisan perception of China as a rival that steals intellectual property, takes advantage of America’s openness and is intent on chipping away at America’s lead. For its part, China is increasingly brazen in pushing back against America (or any country that resists it).

Any retreat by America from global leadership is an opportunity for China

The covid-19 crisis is proving a telling case study of this rivalry, as America blames China for causing the pandemic and China positions itself as the country most capable of dealing with it. Any retreat by America from global leadership is an opportunity for China to gain ground. Whereas America has suspended funding to the WHO, China has promised $2bn to fight the pandemic.

President Xi Jinping portrays China as a champion of multilateralism and talks of taking “an active part in leading the reform of the global governance system”. China has been building channels of influence outside the institutions that America designed. It set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, encroaching on the World Bank’s territory. It has championed the BRICS (bringing it together with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa) and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, an eight-member group that includes Russia and Central Asian countries as well as India and Pakistan. And then there is Mr Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an all-embracing infrastructure and development campaign.

China has also been methodically increasing its influence in existing institutions, not least the UN. It has raised its financial support even as America became stingier, becoming the second-biggest contributor to both the general and the peacekeeping budgets. It has grown more assertive. “Ten years ago, China was pretty discreet, pretending to be just an emerging country,” says one European diplomat at the UN. “Now I can tell you they are totally uninhibited, they want to run the system.”

China has been patiently placing high-fliers to work their way up through the ranks. Chinese nationals now head four of the UN’s 15 specialised agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome and the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva. Americans lead only one. Chinese officials toil away at inserting into documents favourable references to the BRI and language friendly to their interpretation of human rights, stressing national sovereignty and development (“mutual respect and win-win co-operation”). Behind the scenes China twists arms to avoid criticism of its repression in Xinjiang or Tibet.

Small victories for China have mounted up, often in obscure documents and little-noticed forums, but occasionally raising eyebrows. In the 15-member Security Council, for example, the West and its friends can normally count on the requisite nine votes to get their way on procedural matters. But in March 2018 an American-backed proposal for the UN high commissioner for human rights to brief a formal session on abuses in Syria was defeated when, after Chinese pressure, Ivory Coast switched sides at the last minute.

The aim may not be to replace America as a superpower that bears burdens all around the world. More likely, China simply wants an unencumbered path for further development. “People’s Republic of the United Nations”, a report last year from the Centre for a New American Security (CNAS), a think-tank, concluded that China was “making the world safe for autocracy”. For a long time America paid little attention, but it is now pushing back. In January the State Department appointed a senior diplomat, Mark Lambert, to counter the “malign influence” of China and others at the UN. In March these efforts succeeded in thwarting China’s bid for the top job at a fifth UN agency, the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva.

At least such moves reflect a recognition by the American administration that multilateral institutions matter. Just as Mr Trump no longer calls NATO “obsolete”, as he did before coming to power, he may yet find more use in the UN. He would not be the first American president to come to believe that, annoying as international forums are, they are better than a constant free-for-all, and they can take some of the load off a superpower. But his transactional approach has unnerved allies, and badly dented their trust in American leadership.

In search of a middle way

As a result, “middle powers” have been searching for other ways to defend the liberal order. A white paper presented last year by Norway’s foreign ministry to its parliament identified preventing the erosion of international law and multilateral systems as a “primary foreign-policy interest”. In New York, France and Germany launched an Alliance for Multilateralism, with the aim of forging varied coalitions to take the initiative on issues ranging from fake news and responsible use of cyberspace to gender equality and strengthening international institutions.

Coalitions of like-minded countries have proliferated. After Mr Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal, Australia, Japan and nine other countries pressed ahead on their own. The EU and Japan completed a trade agreement covering a third of the world’s GDP. On defence, President Emmanuel Macron of France has gathered 13 other countries into a European Intervention Initiative and is ever keener on “strategic autonomy” for Europe. Asian countries worried about growing Chinese assertiveness, and unsure of America’s commitment, are deepening ties.

In such “minilateralist” or “plurilateralist” ventures, national governments are not the only actors. Regional states, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and business leaders are on stage too. In the response to covid-19, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a philanthropic giant, is taking a more prominent part than many governments. Several American states have been busy since Mr Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, hosted a Global Climate Action Summit in 2018. Totting up actions at subnational levels that collectively would amount to the world’s second-biggest economy, one estimate suggests they could reduce America’s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 by as much as 37% from 2005 levels.

Whether these scattered mid-level moves can amount to more than the sum of their parts is unclear. Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank, suggests that like-minded countries should form a “coalition of the responsible”. Since some middle powers, such as Taiwan and South Korea, have distinguished themselves by their response to the pandemic, he also proposes “coalitions of the competent”. Further bungling by the big powers over covid-19 could make a concert of middle powers more urgent. But do not bank on this being a middle-power moment, says Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, another think-tank. Without a dominant power to set an agenda, force momentum and provide a chunk of funding, it is very hard for co-operation among lesser countries “to reach escape velocity”. At best it may slow rather than stop the erosion of the liberal order.

If middle powers are active, so are smaller ones. By clubbing together, even minnows can have influence. Under its charter the UN is “based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members”, so each of the 193 countries in the General Assembly has one vote. India (1.4bn people) counts the same as Tuvalu (12,000).

The Group of 77, formed in 1964 and now embracing 134 members, pushes the interests of developing countries. It is less homogenous than it was but it can have influence (eg, over the choice of secretary-general) and get attention (picking Palestine to serve as its chair last year). The Alliance of Small Island States helped put the climate-change issue on the map. Samantha Power, America’s UN ambassador during Barack Obama’s second term, made a point of visiting her counterparts from every member country at their New York missions: she managed all except North Korea’s.

With just six embassies around the world, the diplomatic footprint of the Caribbean state of St Vincent and the Grenadines (population: 111,000) is tiny, but a good example of small-country influence. One of its embassies is in Taipei: it is among a handful of states that officially recognise Taiwan. Its mission in New York has been expanding, since St Vincent currently has one of the ten non-permanent seats on the 15-member Security Council. “The bedrock principle that all small states advocate for is adherence to international law,” says Inga Rhonda King, St Vincent’s ambassador. They’re “very hard core” over sovereign equality, non-interference and non-intervention, she adds. The Security Council seat gives her a chance to press core concerns (especially climate security and relations with Africa) and, hers being a small country, to do so nimbly. Ms King would like to see similar nimbleness in the council’s response to covid-19, drawing attention to Africa as the pandemic’s likely next frontier.




目前尚不清楚，这些分散的中层市场波动是否会超过各个部分的总和。澳大利亚智库洛伊研究所的Michael Fullilove建议志同道合的国家应该组成一个“负责任的联盟”。由于一些中等大国，如台湾和韩国，在应对流感大流行方面表现突出，他还建议“有能力的国家联盟”。大国在covid-19问题上的进一步失误可能会使中等大国之间的协调变得更加紧迫。但是，另一个智库美国企业研究所的科里•斯卡克说，不要指望这是一个中庸的时刻。没有一个主导力量来制定议程、推动势头并提供大量资金，较小国家之间的合作很难“达到逃逸速度”。充其量，它可能会减缓而不是阻止自由秩序的侵蚀。

如果中等国家是积极的，那么较小的国家也是积极的。通过联合起来，即使是小鱼也能产生影响。根据联合国宪章，联合国“基于所有成员国主权平等的原则”，因此联合国大会193个成员国各有一票投票权。印度(14亿人口)与图瓦卢(1.2万人口)的人口数量相同。
77国集团成立于1964年，现在有134个成员国，推动发展中国家的利益。虽然它不像以前那样同质，但是它可以有影响力(例如，在秘书长的选择上)并且引起关注(去年选择巴勒斯坦作为其主席)。小岛国家联盟将气候变化问题提上了议事日程。萨曼莎•鲍尔(Samantha Power)曾在巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)第二任期担任美国驻联合国大使，她特意拜访了所有成员国的驻纽约大使:她处理了除朝鲜以外的所有事务。
加勒比海的圣文森特和格林纳丁斯(人口:11.1万)虽然在世界各地只有6个大使馆，但其外交足迹虽小，却是小国影响力的一个很好的例子。它的一个大使馆设在台北:它是少数几个正式承认台湾的国家之一。由于圣文森特目前是安理会15个理事国中10个非常任理事国之一，它在纽约的使命一直在扩大。圣文森特大使英加•朗达•金表示:“所有小国倡导的基本原则就是遵守国际法。”她补充说，他们是主权平等、不干涉和不干涉的“非常坚定的核心”。安理会的席位给了她一个机会来强调核心问题(特别是气候安全和与非洲的关系)，而且，作为一个小国，她可以灵活地做到这一点。金女士希望看到理事会在应对covid-19时也能采取类似的灵活措施，将人们的注意力吸引到非洲，认为非洲可能是该流行病的下一个前沿
